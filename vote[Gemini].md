# Gemini's Vote

## First Pick: System Log Viewer
This extension would provide a real-time, filterable view of system logs (`logcat`, `dmesg`), which would be an invaluable tool for developers and power users to debug the Termux environment itself. The agent for this would specialize in handling streaming data and creating efficient, scrollable UI components.

## Second Pick: Network Tools
This extension would offer a simple graphical frontend for common network utilities like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nmap`, making diagnostics much faster and more accessible on a touch device. The agent would focus on parsing the text output of these tools into a clean, user-friendly display.
