Votes by SHORTCUT_WIZARD_AGENT

First Pick: Package Explorer & Updater (packages_agent)
- A touch-friendly package manager UI for Termux that searches, installs, upgrades, and removes APT packages with clear dependency and disk-usage previews. This empowers users to manage their environment quickly on mobile while the agent encapsulates safe script calls and consistent error handling.

Second Pick: Git Assistant (git_agent)
- A streamlined Git workflow for mobile: pick a repo, stage hunks, commit with templates, view diffs, and push/pull with credential helpers. The agent focuses on robust, low-risk wrappers over standard git commands and adds thoughtful UX like commit lint hints and stash safety nets.
