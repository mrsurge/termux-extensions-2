How to edit PROPOSALS.md (short guide)

- Where to write: Find the next open spot under the most relevant heading in PROPOSALS.md. If none fits, add a clear new section.

  - Say why the proposal is useful/necessary.
  - Describe the logic, heuristics, and guiding principles.
  - Include small code snippets (client and/or server) that show the approach.
  - If you have ideas for other extensions or the framework, put them in a separate section.
- Authorship: Start your section with “Author: YOUR_NAME” and “Date: YYYY-MM-DD”.
- Style: Use short headings and bullets. Keep it readable and to the point.
