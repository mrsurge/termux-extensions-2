# Termux-LM Session Synchronisation Notes

Recent fixes ensure the chat overlay always follows the intended session after drawer interactions and renames:

- `syncActiveSession(modelId, sessionId)` posts to `/models/<id>/sessions/<id>/activate`, updates `state.activeModelId/activeSessionId`, and rehydrates the transcript.
- Session creation (`startSession`, `ensureSession`, drawer "New Session") now calls `syncActiveSession` before opening the overlay.
- The drawer click handler also delegates to `syncActiveSession`, preventing stale state when session cards reorder after a rename.
- `promptRenameSession` persists the new title, hydrates the JSON file, then re-syncs the active session to avoid prompts landing in the renamed session.

With these changes, user prompts are always routed to the selected session regardless of previous renames or drawer ordering.
