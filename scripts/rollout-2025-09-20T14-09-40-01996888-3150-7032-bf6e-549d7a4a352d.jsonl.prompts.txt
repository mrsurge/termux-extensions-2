    "text": "**Framework Shell Proposal**  \n- **Goal**: Provide a core-managed way for extensions/apps to spawn background “framework shells” (e.g., aria2 RPC host, container helpers, llama.cpp servers) that do not consume Termux’s eight visible slots yet remain observable and controllable.\n\n**Architecture**  \n- **Shell Manager Service**: Add a core module (`app/framework_shells.py`) exposing helpers to spawn, track, and terminate shells. Each shell runs under `dtach`, inherits `TE_SESSION_TYPE=framework`, and gets a unique ID (`fs_<timestamp>_<rand>`). Metadata lives in `~/.cache/te_framework/<id>/meta.json` (command, cwd, env, status, created_at).  \n- **Process Lifecycle**: Service watches processes via PID checks. Cleanup removes metadata if the process exits. Provide optional log capture (stdout/err into ring-buffer files under the same directory).  \n\n**Core API Endpoints (tentative)**  \n- `POST /api/framework_shells` → body `{command, cwd?, env?, label?, autostart?}`; spawns shell, returns `{id, pid}`. Enforces allowlist or permissions gate (e.g., only trusted extensions).  \n- `GET /api/framework_shells` → lists active shells with metadata and live stats (`cpu`, `rss`, `uptime`). Stats pulled via `psutil` (dependency) or `/proc`.  \n- `GET /api/framework_shells/<id>` → detailed view plus recent log tail.  \n- `POST /api/framework_shells/<id>/action` → `{action: \"stop\"|\"kill\"|\"restart\"}`; graceful stop sends `SIGTERM`, kill uses `SIGKILL`, restart respawns with same args if `autostart` true.  \n- `DELETE /api/framework_shells/<id>` → force cleanup (stop + metadata purge).  \n\n**Security & Governance**  \n- Only core modules/extensions flagged as “trusted” should access this API. Options:  \n  1) Whitelist extension IDs in config (`FRAMEWORK_SHELL_ALLOWLIST=['aria_downloader', 'container_manager']`).  \n  2) Require a shared secret header configured at install time for server-to-server use.  \n- Enforce home-directory confinement for `cwd` and disallow `command` strings that reference disallowed binaries unless explicitly configured.  \n- Rate-limit shell creation and set max concurrent framework shells to prevent abuse (configurable, default maybe 5).  \n\n**Resource Tracking**  \n- Use `psutil` (add to `requirements.txt`) for per-shell metrics: `cpu_percent`, `memory_info().rss`, optional network I/O. Fallback: parse `/proc/<pid>/{stat,status}` if psutil unavailable.  \n- Expose aggregated totals in the list endpoint so future UI can show overall framework resource consumption.  \n\n**CLI & UI Integration**  \n- Build a simple management UI extension later: shows each shell, command, status, uptime, CPU/RAM bars, kill/restart buttons, log viewer panel. Optional “pin” to highlight critical services.  \n- Consider notifications when a framework shell crashes (push toast via event bus).  \n\n**Configuration**  \n- Add `framework_shells.toml` under project root for defaults: `max_shells`, `allowlist`, `log_retention`, `autostart` definitions for known services (e.g., aria2).  \n- Support auto-start on server boot by reading config and respawning defined shells (store command/args securely; watch out for secrets).  \n\n**Implementation Phases**  \n1. **Backend core**: build service module + API endpoints, integrate with startup (`app/main.py`) and ensure `TE_SESSION_TYPE=framework` hidden from Sessions list.  \n2. **Resource stats**: introduce psutil, wire stats polling.  \n3. **Auto-start config**: allow declarative shell definitions.  \n4. **UI management extension** (optional but recommended).  \n5. **Documentation**: update `CORE_API_MANUAL.md`, create dedicated design doc in `/docs/framework_shells.md`.  \n\n**Risk Mitigation**  \n- Validate commands carefully; optionally require command arrays instead of shell strings to avoid injection (`subprocess.Popen([...])`).  \n- Ensure cleanup on crash by periodic sweeps removing stale metadata.  \n- Provide explicit kill endpoints so runaway services can be halted even if their extension misbehaves.  \n- Logging should avoid unbounded growth (cap file size or rotate).  \n\nLet me know if you want me to start drafting the technical spec doc or begin backend scaffolding."

Here’s how I’m thinking about it, and some questions we should settle before any coding happens:\n\n- **Primary goals**  \n  - Manage proot-distro and/or chroot-distro environments: install, start, stop, run commands, maybe show resource usage.  \n  - Lean heavily on the framework shell API so container daemons run invisibly in the background.  \n  - Integrate with Sessions & Shortcuts for “run command in specific Termux session” scenarios where that makes sense.\n\n- **Key decisions to hash out**  \n  1. **Scope split**: Does one app handle both proot and chroot flows with per-plugin adapters, or should we spin separate flows (e.g., `proot` plugin, `chroot` plugin) selectable in the UI?  \n  2. **Runtime model**: Do we control containers via long-lived framework shells (best for background services) or rely on user-chosen interactive sessions for certain tasks?  \n  3. **User interaction**: Instead of embedding a raw terminal, maybe we present actions: “Open shell in new Session,” “Start service,” “Mount / stop,” etc. If logs are needed, we can stream from the framework-shell logs rather than emulating a terminal.  \n  4. **Integration with Sessions extension**: We can consume its API to list available sessions or create new ones on demand. Do we want the app to auto-select an idle session, or prompt the user to pick?  \n  5. **Permissions & safety**: chroot/proot operations can be gnarly; we need guardrails to avoid accidentally nuking a running container or the host environment.\n\n- **Next steps I’d propose**  \n  1. Draft a design doc outlining workflows (install, start, attach, stop, delete) and mapping each to either a framework shell action or a Sessions-ext API call.  \n  2. Identify which CLI tools we rely on (`proot-distro`, `chroot-distro`, custom scripts) so we can codify them in the agent brief.  \n  3. Decide on UI structure: e.g., cards per distro, status badges, buttons for lifecycle actions, logs panel, link-out to open a terminal session if needed.  \n  4. Once the design is crisp, craft the agent instruction file similar to Aria’s, with guardrails and API contracts.\n\nLet me know how you’d like to resolve the questions above—particularly the plugin split and interaction model—and I’ll start drafting the doc/instructions accordingly."

That command can keep a long-lived init/service running, or just drop you into a shell.\n- If we launch that command inside a framework shell, the background process stays alive even after the user leaves—perfect definition of the **Running** state.  \n- When the framework shell exits (user stopped it, it crashed, or we killed it), we flip back to **Mounted** or **Offline** depending on whether the filesystem is still set up.\n- For one-shot, interactive sessions (just “open a shell and then exit”), we wouldn’t keep the shell running: once the process ends, the state drops back automatically.\n\nSo in the Distro app, “Running” is: “there’s an active framework shell associated with this container, and its PID is alive.” That keeps things consistent and lets us reuse the start/stop/restart mechanics we just built."

Let the user pick a session and send a `proot-distro login <name>` (or equivalent chroot command) via the existing `POST /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions/<sid>/command`, or\n  2. Spin up a fresh Termux session (e.g., by triggering your existing shortcut/init script) and then run the attach command there.\n\nThat way the interactive terminal lives in a real Termux window—no need for us to render a browser-based console—and the framework shell keeps the container running independently of the user’s front-end session."

    "text": "Got it.\n\n### Your Current Flow\n- You mount the SD card with `sudo mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p1 /data/data/com.termux/files/chroot-exec-mnt/`.\n- Each distro lives under `.../rootfs/<distro>`—so Ubuntu maps to `/data/data/com.termux/files/chroot-exec-mnt/rootfs/ubuntu`, which becomes `/` inside the chroot.\n- You enter the container by exporting `CHROOT_DISTRO_PATH` to that rootfs parent and running `sudo chroot-distro login ubuntu`.\n\n### What That Tells Us\n1. **Mount Phase:** Before any distro operations, a custom device mount happens. That’s outside the stock chroot-distro workflow, so our automation must manage block devices + mount points explicitly.\n2. **Rootfs Discovery:** Unlike the default layout (`/data/local/chroot-distro/<distro>`), you’re passing an explicit `CHROOT_DISTRO_PATH`, so we need a config model that lets you supply an arbitrary rootfs location per distro (and persist it).\n3. **Login / command execution:** Once the environment variables point to the right tree, `chroot-distro login` works as usual—our app would call it via framework shells or session injection.\n\n### Path Forward\n- **Design a plugin for chroot-distro** inside the Distro app that:\n  - Knows how to mount/unmount your SD card wrapper (with per-container mount directives).\n  - Sets `CHROOT_DISTRO_PATH` dynamically before issuing `login`, `command`, etc.\n  - Uses the new framework shell API to keep a long-running shell alive while the container is “Running”.\n\n- **Config Schema:** something like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"id\": \"ubuntu\",\n    \"type\": \"chroot-distro\",\n    \"rootfs\": \"/data/data/.../rootfs/ubuntu\",\n    \"mounts\": [\n      { \"device\": \"/dev/block/mmcblk1p1\", \"target\": \"/data/data/.../chroot-exec-mnt\", \"fs\": \"auto\", \"options\": \"rw\" }\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"CHROOT_DISTRO_PATH\": \"/data/data/.../rootfs\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  That lets other use cases swap in different mount devices, rootfs paths, or even chain multiple mounts without breaking the UI.\n\n- **Workflow abstraction:**\n  1. For each distro definition, run its mount plan (framework shell or short-lived sudo commands).\n  2. Spawn a framework shell with `env=...` and `command=['chroot-distro','login', distro]`.\n  3. Mark state transitions (Mounted → Running). When the shell exits, drop back to Mounted and offer to restart.\n\n- **Extensibility:** Once this is modeled, proot-distro or future container types can use the same state machine, just with different boot scripts.\n\n**Next Steps (once we unpin Distro work):**\n- Capture your mount + entry workflow in the Distro design doc so the agent knows exactly how to reproduce it.\n- Extend the Distro app scaffold (and agent brief) to include these config keys and lifecycle hooks.\n- Implement the plugin that wraps `chroot-distro` commands while honoring per-container env/mount definitions.\n\nWhenever you’re ready to resume the Distro implementation, we can formalize this into the agent instructions and start wiring the backend to match."

Config lives at `app/apps/distro/config/containers.json` (currently `[]`).\n- Created the frontend shell (`app/apps/distro/template.html`, `app/apps/distro/main.js`) that lists containers, shows status badges, wires actions (mount, unmount, start, stop, log viewer), and polls for updates. Logs open in a modal; shell hand-off is stubbed with a toast for now.\n- Introduced a shared file/directory picker (`app/static/js/file_picker.js`) and loaded it globally (`app/templates/index.html`, `app/templates/app_shell.html`), plus documentation (`docs/shared_file_picker.md`).

The mount/start logic executes real `sudo`/`chroot-distro` commands—testing will require your rooted environment. No automated tests were run.\n\n**Next Steps (suggested)**  \n1. Populate `app/apps/distro/config/containers.json` with your Ubuntu SD-card layout and verify mounts/start/stop in a rooted session.  \n2. Implement session hand-off (Sessions & Shortcuts API) and richer error handling/log streaming.  \n3. Expand plugin support (proot-distro, additional mount options) once the chroot flow is validated."

No manual refresh needed.\n- **Attaching to a session** happens from the Distro `…` menu via a “Attach to Session…” item. Picking that option opens a modal that lists the idle sessions returned by the Sessions & Shortcuts API (we can reuse its existing dropdown logic instead of hand-rolling a new UI). Selecting one injects the login command; the UI records the attachment and the session card now shows a “Container: <name>” badge.\n- **Once attached**, every time the Distro dashboard refreshes it pulls the same status and shows those attached session cards. Removing an attachment (or when the session exits) automatically prunes the list.\n- **Sessions & Shortcuts side**: split the view into two tabs—Visible vs Framework/Hidden. In the framework tab we expose only stop/kill actions (no injection) plus lightweight metadata (PID, uptime) pulled from the `/api/framework_shells` stats. Session cards display any linked container names so the relationship is obvious at a glance.\n\nThis way we lean on the Sessions & Shortcuts API wherever possible—no brand-new backend designs other than a small “attach” helper in the Distro app that calls the existing `POST /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions/<sid>/command` endpoint.

That means nothing is keeping the `chroot-distro login ubuntu` process running—either the command returns immediately or whatever it launches exits right away. After a restart there’s simply no process left for the framework manager to bind to, so even though we label-match the shell record, it’s not actually alive (and the UI correctly sees only a mounted filesystem, not an active init).\n\nSo the problem isn’t the label detection; it’s that the login command isn’t staying attached to a real shell process the way aria2 does. To dig further we’d want to confirm:\n\n- What process (if any) is hanging around after `chroot-distro login ubuntu` runs—does it remain running, or exit immediately?  \n- Whether chroot-distro provides a “daemon mode” or some hook (dtach/tmux) to launch a persistent init; right now we’re just firing `sudo chroot-distro login <id>` in the framework shell, but if that shell isn’t event-looping on its own, there will be nothing left for us to monitor.\n\nOnce we know how to keep the container’s init alive (or at least detect the supervising process), we can make the Distro card pick up the stats the way aria2 does.

The remaining task was to patch the Distro backend so it reclassifies a container as running if an active session still has `chroot-distro login <id>` in its foreground command. Plan is to pull the Sessions & Shortcuts data on load, map those sessions back to containers, and feed that into `_serialize_container` so stats/attachments repopulate after a restart. Ready to wire that up whenever you give the word."

    "text": "**Aria2 vs Distro Shell Handling**\n\n- `app/apps/aria_downloader/main.py:70-206` keeps a durable record (`STATE_FILE`) of the active framework shell (id, command, cwd, autostart). On restart, `get_tracked_shell()` (lines 214-241) reloads that config, asks the shared manager for the record, and clears state only if the manager can’t find it. This guarantees the UI always rehydrates against the actual shell metadata.\n- The Aria2 backend never loses the PID because the spawned command (`aria2c …`) is the long-lived process itself (`spawn_shell` at lines 286-331). The manager’s `describe` call therefore reports `stats.alive=True`, so the UI sees the shell as running with fresh uptime/cpu/memory on every refresh.\n- Aria2 exposes an explicit “adopt” action (`shell/action` with `adopt`, lines 332-373) so it can retake ownership of a pre-existing framework shell by id or label. It always talks to the singleton manager via `_framework_manager()` (`app/apps/aria_downloader/main.py:209`), ensuring one source of truth for all shell records.\n\n**Where Distro Differs**\n\n- We persist container state in `app/apps/distro/state.json`, but after a restart the stored `shell_id` points to a record whose `pid` is already `None` and `status` is `exited` (`~/.cache/te_framework/meta/fs_…/meta.json`). The root cause is the launch command: `sudo chroot-distro login <id>` (`app/apps/distro/main.py:422-426`) hands control to `sudo/chroot-distro`, which spawns the session and then exits. From the framework manager’s perspective that process is gone, so subsequent `describe` calls report a dead shell, and `_serialize_container` downgrades the state back to `mounted`.\n- We try to infer liveness by scanning Termux sessions (front-end call at `app/apps/distro/main.js:337-362`), but the backend never consumes that data—`_serialize_container` (lines 240-278) still relies solely on manager stats to classify the container. Unlike Aria2, we’re not re-attaching to any persistent runner process, so there’s nothing for `FrameworkShellManager` to measure.\n- Distro instantiates its own manager instance (`framework_shells = FrameworkShellManager()` at `app/apps/distro/main.py:22`) instead of using the shared factory. That works today because everyone points at the same on-disk cache, but it skips the memoized manager that Aria2 relies on and makes it harder to coordinate future cross-app shell orchestration (auth token, limits, etc.).\n\n**How to Cross-Pollinate**\n\n- Make the container’s tracked process long-lived, similar to Aria2’s service model. For example, wrap the login in a keep-alive script (`chroot-distro exec … 'tmux new-session -d …'`) or launch a supervisory shim that stays in the foreground, so the manager retains a valid PID and `stats.alive` remains true across restarts.\n- Feed the session scan back into `_serialize_container`: if a framework shell record shows `exited` but we can see an attached session running `chroot-distro login <id>`, treat it as running, update the state entry, and refresh stats (reuse the plan the previous agent sketched—map sessions by `fg_cmdline`/`fg_comm` and hydrate attachments).\n- Adopt the Aria2 pattern for manager access and shell adoption: switch to `get_framework_shell_manager()` so we share the global limits, and add an `adopt` endpoint to let users rebind the app to a live shell by id or label without respawning. This mirrors the existing `/shell/action` flow and gives us a clean escape hatch if metadata gets out of sync.\n\nNext steps I’d tackle: 1) wire the session-aware rehydration into `_serialize_container` so the UI can at least recognize already-running shells, then 2) prototype a wrapper command that keeps the framework PID alive (even something simple like `sudo chroot-distro login <id> -- run 'sleep infinity'`) so we match Aria2’s lifecycle and regain accurate stats."
