# Agent Development Guide: sessions_and_shortcuts

## 1. High-Level Goal

Your primary role is to act as a **debugging and maintenance chatbot** for the `sessions_and_shortcuts` extension. You will answer questions about its functionality, explain its code, and help diagnose issues. You will use your knowledge of the Core APIs and the extension's own code to provide accurate information.

## 2. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails

**You are a debugging assistant. You MUST NOT write or modify any code unless explicitly instructed to do so as part of a bug-fixing process.**

1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** You are strictly forbidden from editing any file outside of your assigned extension's subdirectory: `/app/extensions/sessions_and_shortcuts/`.
2.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** All interactions with the system are handled by Core APIs. Your analysis should be based on how the extension code calls these APIs.

## 3. Core API Manual

(A full API manual is available in `CORE_API_MANUAL.md`. As a summary, you will primarily be concerned with how this extension uses the following endpoints.)

*   `GET /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions`: Lists active Termux sessions.
*   `GET /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/shortcuts`: Lists available scripts in `~/.shortcuts`.
*   `POST /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions/<sid>/command`: Runs a command in a session.
*   `POST /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions/<sid>/shortcut`: Runs a shortcut script in a session.
*   `DELETE /api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts/sessions/<sid>`: Kills a session.

## 4. Extension Overview

The `sessions_and_shortcuts` extension is responsible for all direct interaction with live Termux shells. Its `main.js` file fetches the list of sessions and renders them. It handles the logic for the `...` menu, allowing users to run commands, execute scripts, and terminate sessions by calling its own backend API endpoints, which in turn execute the necessary shell scripts (`list_sessions.sh`, `run_in_session.sh`, etc.).

# Agent Development Guide for Termux Extensions

## 1. High-Level Goal

Your primary goal is to develop a self-contained extension within the `app/extensions/` directory. You will consume the Core APIs provided by the main framework to build your features.

## 2. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails

**YOU MUST ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING RULES. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL CORRUPT THE PROJECT.**

1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** You are strictly forbidden from editing any file outside of your assigned extension's subdirectory. Core files include, but are not limited to:
    *   `/app/main.py`
    *   `/app/templates/index.html`
    *   Any file in `/scripts/`
    *   Any file in `/docs/`
    *   The project's `TODO.md` or `README.md`

2.  **WORK ONLY WITHIN YOUR EXTENSION DIRECTORY.** For the "Shortcut Wizard", your entire workspace is `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/`. All new files (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`) must be created here.

3.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** Do not attempt to implement your own file browsing or shell execution logic. All interaction with the underlying system MUST go through the documented Core APIs listed below.

## 3. Core API Manual

The main application provides the following core API endpoints for use by all extensions.

---

### **File System**

#### `GET /api/browse`
Lists the contents of a directory.

*   **Query Parameters:**
    *   `path` (string, optional): The absolute path to browse. Defaults to the user's home directory (`~`).
*   **Success Response (200):**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "directory_name",
        "type": "directory",
        "path": "/path/to/directory_name"
      },
      {
        "name": "file.txt",
        "type": "file",
        "path": "/path/to/file.txt"
      }
    ]
    ```
*   **Error Response (403/500):**
    ```json
    { "error": "Descriptive error message" }
    ```

--- 

### **Command Execution**

#### `POST /api/run_command`
Executes a generic shell command and returns its standard output. This is the primary method for extensions to get data from the system.

*   **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "command": "your-command-here"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (200):**
    ```json
    {
      "stdout": "The output of the command..."
    }
    ```
*   **Error Response (500):**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Command failed",
      "stderr": "The error output of the command..."
    }
    ```

---

### **System Information**

*(This section is deprecated. Use `/api/run_command` instead.)*

--- 

## 4. Instructions for `shortcut_wizard` Extension

### Task 1: UI Polish
- **Lowercase Inputs:** In `main.js`, for all relevant text input fields in the editor, add an event listener that forces the first word of any input to be lowercase. This is a quality-of-life improvement for mobile keyboards.
- **Simple Editor:** In `main.js`, modify the `renderEditList` function. When a user clicks on a shortcut where `is_editable` is `false`, do not open the wizard. Instead, show a new, simple modal containing a large `<textarea>`. Fetch the raw content of the script file and display it in the textarea for viewing or simple edits.

### Task 2: Wire up UI to APIs
- **File Browser:** The "Browse" button (`&#128193;`) next to an argument's value field should open the file browser modal. Use the `/api/browse` endpoint to populate it. When a file is selected, its path should populate the input field. When "Select Current Dir" is clicked, the current directory's path should be used.
- **$PATH Executable Picker:** The `$` button next to the main command input should call a new API endpoint (to be created by the framework agent) that lists all executables on the `$PATH`. This list should be displayed in a modal for the user to select from.

### Task 3: Multi-Command and Piping
- **"Add Command" Button:** In `main.js`, make this button functional. When clicked, it should append a new "Command Block" to the editor UI. A command block consists of a command input and its associated arguments section.
- **Visual Separator:** Between each command block, render a distinct visual separator (e.g., `<hr class="pipe-separator">`) that includes a small "remove" button (`&times;`) to delete that command block.
- **Backend Script Generation:** In `main.py`, update the `/create` endpoint. It must now be able to receive an array of command blocks. When generating the final `.sh` file, it should join each command block with a pipe (`|`).

# Project Specification: termux-extensions-2

This document outlines the architecture and design of the `termux-extensions-2` project.

## 1. Core Framework

The backend is a Python web server built with the Flask framework. It uses a helper function to execute shell scripts from a dedicated `scripts/` directory, which act as a bridge to the Termux environment.

**`app/main.py` - Flask App Initialization:**
```python
import json
import os
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
scripts_dir = os.path.join(project_root, 'scripts')

def run_script(script_name, args=None):
    """Helper function to run a shell script and return its output."""
    # ... implementation ...
```

## 2. REST API

The Flask server exposes a simple REST API that the frontend consumes to get data and perform actions. The API endpoints call the underlying shell scripts and return their output as JSON.

**`app/main.py` - Session API Endpoint:**
```python
@app.route('/api/sessions', methods=['GET'])
def get_sessions():
    """Lists all active, interactive sessions."""
    output, error = run_script('list_sessions.sh')
    if error:
        return jsonify({'error': error}), 500
    try:
        return jsonify(json.loads(output))
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to decode JSON from script.', 'output': output}), 500
```

## 3. Shell Interaction Layer

# Project Specification: termux-extensions-2

This document outlines the implemented architecture of the `termux-extensions-2` project.

## 1. Modular Architecture

The framework is built on a modular architecture where features are encapsulated in self-contained **extensions**. The main Flask application is responsible for discovering, loading, and serving these extensions.

### 1.1. Extension Discovery

On startup, the main application scans the `app/extensions/` directory for subdirectories. Each valid extension is identified by the presence of a `manifest.json` file.

**`app/extensions/sessions_and_shortcuts/manifest.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "Sessions & Shortcuts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "View and interact with active Termux sessions and run shortcuts.",
  "author": "Gemini",
  "entrypoints": {
    "backend_blueprint": "main.py",
    "frontend_template": "template.html",
    "frontend_script": "main.js"
  }
}
```

### 1.2. Backend Loading

The core backend in `app/main.py` dynamically loads each extension's Python code as a Flask **Blueprint**. This registers the extension's specific API routes under a unique prefix (e.g., `/api/ext/sessions_and_shortcuts`).

**`app/main.py` - Extension Loading Snippet:**
```python
def load_extensions():
    # ...
    for ext_name in os.listdir(extensions_dir):
        # ... read manifest ...

        # Dynamically load and register the blueprint
        backend_file = manifest.get('entrypoints', {}).get('backend_blueprint')
        if backend_file:
            # ... importlib code to load module ...
            
            # Find the blueprint object in the loaded module
            from flask import Blueprint
            for obj_name in dir(module):
                obj = getattr(module, obj_name)
                if isinstance(obj, Blueprint):
                    app.register_blueprint(obj, url_prefix=f"/api/ext/{ext_name}")
                    break
    return extensions
```

### 1.3. Frontend Loading

The main `index.html` page acts as a shell. Its JavaScript fetches a list of available extensions from the `/api/extensions` endpoint. For each extension, it dynamically fetches the HTML template and injects it into the page, then loads the corresponding JavaScript module to make it interactive.

**`app/templates/index.html` - Extension Loader Snippet:**
```javascript
async function loadExtensions() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/extensions');
    const extensions = await response.json();

    for (const ext of extensions) {
        // ... create container div ...

        // 1. Fetch and inject the extension's HTML template
        const templatePath = `/extensions/${ext._ext_dir}/${ext.entrypoints.frontend_template}`;
        const templateResponse = await fetch(templatePath);
        extContainer.innerHTML = await templateResponse.text();

        // 2. Dynamically import and initialize the extension's JavaScript module
        const scriptPath = `/extensions/${ext._ext_dir}/${ext.entrypoints.frontend_script}`;
        const module = await import(scriptPath);
        
        // Create a scoped API object for the extension and initialize
        const api = { /* ... */ };
        module.default(extContainer, api);
    }
}
```

## 2. Shell Interaction Layer

The bridge to the Termux environment is a set of shell scripts in the `/scripts` directory.

*   **`init.sh`**: Hooks into interactive shells using `dtach` to make them controllable.
*   **`list_sessions.sh`**: Scans for metadata files in `~/.cache/te` and produces a JSON list of active sessions.
*   **`run_in_session.sh`**: Injects a command into a specified session's `dtach` socket.
*   **`list_shortcuts.sh`**: Scans `~/.shortcuts` for executable files.


### 3.1. Session Hooking (`init.sh`)

When sourced, this script wraps the current interactive shell in a `dtach` session, making it controllable. It forces the new `dtach`-managed shell to re-source this same script, which then proceeds to create a metadata directory in `~/.cache/te/` that makes the session discoverable.

**`scripts/init.sh` - Snippet:**
```bash
# 2. If not already inside dtach, re-execute the shell inside dtach.
if [ "${TE_DTACH:-0}" != "1" ] && command -v dtach >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  run_base="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.local/run}/te"
  mkdir -p "$run_base"
  sock="$run_base/$PPID-$-$RANDOM.sock"

  export TE_DTACH=1
  export TE_SOCK="$sock"

  # Use --rcfile to force the new shell to source this script
  # before becoming interactive.
  exec dtach -A "$sock" bash --rcfile "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
fi

# 3. If we are here, we are inside the dtach-managed shell.
#    Run the setup function.
setup_session_metadata
```

### 3.2. Session Discovery (`list_sessions.sh`)

This script is called by the `/api/sessions` endpoint. It scans the `~/.cache/te` directory, filters for valid sessions where `SESSION_TYPE` is `interactive`, and outputs a clean JSON array.

**`scripts/list_sessions.sh` - Snippet:**
```bash
# ...
find "$CACHE_DIR" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | while read -r session_dir;
do
  meta_file="$session_dir/meta"

  if [ ! -f "$meta_file" ]; then continue; fi

  CWD=""; SID=""; SESSION_TYPE=""; SOCK=""
  . "$meta_file"

  if [ "$SESSION_TYPE" != "interactive" ]; then continue; fi
  if ! ps -p "$SID" > /dev/null; then
    rm -rf "$session_dir"
    continue
  fi

  if [ "$first" = true ]; then first=false; else echo ","; fi

  # ... escape values ...

  # Print the session details as a compact JSON object
  printf '{"sid":"%s","cwd":"%s","sock":"%s"}' "$sid_esc" "$cwd_esc" "$sock_esc"
done
```

## 4. Frontend UI

The user interface is a single HTML file that uses modern CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript to dynamically interact with the backend API.

**`app/templates/index.html` - Session Rendering Snippet:**
```javascript
const renderSessions = (sessions) => {
    sessionsList.innerHTML = '';
    if (sessions.length === 0) {
        sessionsList.innerHTML = '<p style="color: var(--muted-foreground);">No interactive sessions found.</p>';
        return;
    }
    sessions.forEach(session => {
        const sessionEl = document.createElement('div');
        sessionEl.className = 'session';
        sessionEl.innerHTML = `
            <div class="session-header">
                <div class="session-title">SID: ${session.sid}</div>
                <button class="menu-btn" data-sid="${session.sid}">&#8942;</button>
            </div>
            <div class="session-cwd">${session.cwd}</div>
            <div class="menu" id="menu-${session.sid}">
                <div class="menu-item" data-action="run-shortcut">Run Shortcut...</div>
                <div class="menu-item" data-action="run-command">Run Command...</div>
                <div class="menu-item destructive" data-action="kill">Kill Session</div>
            </div>
        `;
        sessionsList.appendChild(sessionEl);
    });
};
```

[{'type': 'reasoning_text', 'text': '**Considering shortcut functionality**\n\nI’m noticing that there are multiple extensions involved. The docs mention that modals exist in the main index.html but are triggered by extensions. However, in this template, it looks like modals are integrated directly into the extension\'s DOM. The user is saying the "run shortcut function" seems broken because it requires selecting a session first. The alert about the session not being set suggests that currentSessionId might not be initialized properly during the openModal call. It’s important to dig into that.**Inspecting modal function behavior**\n\nI’m checking the `window.openModal` function, which is supposed to set `currentSessionId` and display a modal. The event handler does call `openModal(\'shortcut-modal\', sid)`, but I wonder if it\'s being referenced correctly. The code assigns `window.openModal` to the global scope, but inside the module, it looks like it’s calling a different `openModal` without referencing the global. Since ES modules don’t add globals to the top-level namespace, calling `openModal` without `window` may fail in strict mode. I need to figure that out!**Analyzing modal error behavior**\n\nI’m thinking that the code should throw a ReferenceError when trying to invoke `openModal(\'shortcut-modal\', sid)`, since `openModal` seems undefined. Despite this, the user is seeing "Please select a session..." which indicates the `runShortcut` function runs successfully, but `currentSessionId` is still null. Maybe `openModal` exists due to global variable injection in the browser? In a JS module context, I should use `window.openModal`, but what happens if modules aren\'t involved? I need to clarify this!**Exploring dynamic imports and modal behavior**\n\nI’m considering whether extension scripts are imported as ES modules since the docs show a dynamic import with `await import(scriptPath);`. This means `openModal` wouldn\'t be in scope naturally. They call `openModal` instead of `window.openModal`, which might lead to a ReferenceError. Strangely, the user didn\'t mention a console error but they did see the alert "Please select a session..." That implies the modal likely opened because they clicked "Run Shortcut..." in the session menu. I\'m trying to pinpoint how this all connects!**Investigating modal and shortcut behavior**\n\nI’m recognizing that users might be selecting shortcuts in the list displayed by `renderShortcuts`. The `#shortcut-list` is part of the `#shortcut-modal`, so if the modal isn\'t opened, I wonder if they could still see the list if CSS isn\'t properly applying. If `openModal` isn’t defined, it would lead to a ReferenceError when called, causing issues with `currentSessionId`. There might be an asynchronous timing issue here too, where `api.get(\'shortcuts\')` resolves before `openModal`. I need to dive deeper into the CSS and index template!'}]

[{'type': 'reasoning_text', 'text': '**Considering shortcut functionality**\n\nI’m noticing that there are multiple extensions involved. The docs mention that modals exist in the main index.html but are triggered by extensions. However, in this template, it looks like modals are integrated directly into the extension\'s DOM. The user is saying the "run shortcut function" seems broken because it requires selecting a session first. The alert about the session not being set suggests that currentSessionId might not be initialized properly during the openModal call. It’s important to dig into that.**Inspecting modal function behavior**\n\nI’m checking the `window.openModal` function, which is supposed to set `currentSessionId` and display a modal. The event handler does call `openModal(\'shortcut-modal\', sid)`, but I wonder if it\'s being referenced correctly. The code assigns `window.openModal` to the global scope, but inside the module, it looks like it’s calling a different `openModal` without referencing the global. Since ES modules don’t add globals to the top-level namespace, calling `openModal` without `window` may fail in strict mode. I need to figure that out!**Analyzing modal error behavior**\n\nI’m thinking that the code should throw a ReferenceError when trying to invoke `openModal(\'shortcut-modal\', sid)`, since `openModal` seems undefined. Despite this, the user is seeing "Please select a session..." which indicates the `runShortcut` function runs successfully, but `currentSessionId` is still null. Maybe `openModal` exists due to global variable injection in the browser? In a JS module context, I should use `window.openModal`, but what happens if modules aren\'t involved? I need to clarify this!**Exploring dynamic imports and modal behavior**\n\nI’m considering whether extension scripts are imported as ES modules since the docs show a dynamic import with `await import(scriptPath);`. This means `openModal` wouldn\'t be in scope naturally. They call `openModal` instead of `window.openModal`, which might lead to a ReferenceError. Strangely, the user didn\'t mention a console error but they did see the alert "Please select a session..." That implies the modal likely opened because they clicked "Run Shortcut..." in the session menu. I\'m trying to pinpoint how this all connects!**Investigating modal and shortcut behavior**\n\nI’m recognizing that users might be selecting shortcuts in the list displayed by `renderShortcuts`. The `#shortcut-list` is part of the `#shortcut-modal`, so if the modal isn\'t opened, I wonder if they could still see the list if CSS isn\'t properly applying. If `openModal` isn’t defined, it would lead to a ReferenceError when called, causing issues with `currentSessionId`. There might be an asynchronous timing issue here too, where `api.get(\'shortcuts\')` resolves before `openModal`. I need to dive deeper into the CSS and index template!'}]

  "message": "I’ve read CORE_API_MANUAL.md, docs/UI_FLOW.md, docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md, and SESSIONS_AGENT.txt, then traced the extension code.\n\n**Root Cause**\n- In `app/extensions/sessions_and_shortcuts/main.js`, the code defines `window.openModal` and `window.closeModal`, but later calls `openModal(...)`/`closeModal(...)` without the `window.` prefix.\n- Because the extension is loaded as an ES module (dynamic `import` in `app/templates/index.html`), unqualified globals don’t resolve to `window.*` in strict mode. That call throws before `currentSessionId` is set.\n\n**Why You See “Select a session first”**\n- The click handler for “Run Shortcut...” does:\n  - `api.get('shortcuts').then(renderShortcuts);`\n  - `openModal('shortcut-modal', sid);` ← throws ReferenceError in module strict mode.\n- The fetch still completes and renders the shortcut list, but `currentSessionId` never gets set (the modal open step failed), so clicking a shortcut triggers the alert that a session must be selected.\n\n**Evidence (pointers)**\n- Define globals: `window.openModal = (modalId, sid) => { currentSessionId = sid; ... }` and `window.closeModal = ...` (main.js, ~lines 57–67).\n- Called incorrectly: `openModal('command-modal', sid)` and `openModal('shortcut-modal', sid)` (~lines 101, 103) and `closeModal(...)` uses (~lines 78, 122) without `window.`.\n\n**Fix Options**\n- Minimal: Replace unqualified calls with `window.openModal(...)` and `window.closeModal(...)`.\n- Better: Define local functions and keep globals only for template buttons:\n  - `const openModal = (modalId, sid) => { currentSessionId = sid; document.getElementById(modalId).style.display = 'block'; };`\n  - `const closeModal = (modalId) => { document.getElementById(modalId).style.display = 'none'; };`\n  - Keep `window.closeModal = closeModal` for the template `onclick`.\n\nWould you like me to apply the minimal patch in `main.js` to use `window.openModal`/`window.closeModal` (or refactor to local functions as above)?",

This situation could occur if the function `runShortcut` is called before `openModal` has a chance to set it, especially if `renderShortcuts` executes first. The asynchronous nature of JavaScript promises means `renderShortcuts` runs after the API call returns, potentially before this ID is set. Even if fetches return quickly, the order should ensure the session ID is set properly beforehand. It’s important to consider how user interactions might affect this sequence.**Analyzing function behavior**\n\nI’m looking into how `renderShortcuts` triggers `runShortcut` without passing the session ID (sid). It seems that `runShortcut` relies on the `currentSessionId` variable, which should be set. However, I\'m noticing that the error message, "need to select the session first," suggests that this ID is null when `runShortcut` executes. Maybe it has to do with how `sessions_and_shortcuts` is loaded or scoping issues. I’ll also check the query selector for `#shortcut-list` to ensure it\'s functioning correctly within the `extensionContainer`.**Troubleshooting runShortcut error**\n\nI\'m investigating why the error shows up when `runShortcut` is called by clicking a shortcut. It seems the `sid` might not be getting passed correctly, especially if the menu has an ID like \'menu-undefined.\' Initially, the menu ID is generated with "menu-${session.sid}", which looks fine at first glance. However, if something goes wrong with the button dataset, it could lead to issues. Also, I wonder if users are trying to access the Shortcut modal in ways that bypass the intended flow.**Identifying the session persistence issue**\n\nI’m considering that the problem might be related to `currentSessionId` not persisting when the modal is opened. The `openModal` function sets this ID, but it’s only invoked after a fetch call in the `run-shortcut` case. Since this is done asynchronously, there shouldn\'t be an issue. However, the user pointed out that the `runShortcut` function needs to be initiated from a specific session, suggesting that it might be incorrectly checking for a session even when it\'s obvious we are already in the right context.**Analyzing openModal reference issues**\n\nI\'m diving into why `openModal` isn\'t functioning properly, especially with the potential of it being overshadowed by global definitions across extensions. If another extension resets `window.openModal`, it could affect the setting of `currentSessionId`. Interestingly, when I look at the code, it seems there\'s confusion with scoping and how it\'s declared. In module scope, if `openModal` isn\'t explicitly declared, it should throw a ReferenceError, yet the user reports a different error about needing to select a session. This suggests there\'s something obscure happening in the execution context or with how the environment resolves variable references.**Diagnosing the openModal and closeModal issues**\n\nI\'m digging into why `openModal` might not be working as intended. Given that `openModal` is referenced incorrectly as a variable instead of calling `window.openModal`, this means `currentSessionId` remains null, leading to the alert asking users to select a session. If an error occurs, it disrupts the code execution flow. Even though the modal might appear visible, it seems the shortcuts aren\'t actionable due to these underlying issues. I suspect the root cause lies in the unqualified calls to `openModal` and `closeModal`, which should be prefixed with `window.` to avoid any ReferenceErrors.**Compiling the Diagnosis**\n\nI want to start by reporting my diagnosis clearly and concisely, pointing to specific code lines, and suggesting a minimal fix while offering to apply it if the user wants. I should follow the guidelines by organizing this into bullet points with code identifiers in monospace. \n\nFirst, checking backend route names shows consistency between front and backend. The issue arises because `openModal` is referenced incorrectly, causing `currentSessionId` to remain null in an ES module context. When fetching shortcuts, the user only sees "select a session," masking the underlying ReferenceError. I’ll outline the root cause, impact, proof, fix options, and next steps.'}]

It seems that `runShortcut` relies on the `currentSessionId` variable, which should be set. However, I\'m noticing that the error message, "need to select the session first," suggests that this ID is null when `runShortcut` executes. Maybe it has to do with how `sessions_and_shortcuts` is loaded or scoping issues. I’ll also check the query selector for `#shortcut-list` to ensure it\'s functioning correctly within the `extensionContainer`.**Troubleshooting runShortcut error**\n\nI\'m investigating why the error shows up when `runShortcut` is called by clicking a shortcut. It seems the `sid` might not be getting passed correctly, especially if the menu has an ID like \'menu-undefined.\' Initially, the menu ID is generated with "menu-${session.sid}", which looks fine at first glance. However, if something goes wrong with the button dataset, it could lead to issues. Also, I wonder if users are trying to access the Shortcut modal in ways that bypass the intended flow.**Identifying the session persistence issue**\n\nI’m considering that the problem might be related to `currentSessionId` not persisting when the modal is opened. The `openModal` function sets this ID, but it’s only invoked after a fetch call in the `run-shortcut` case. Since this is done asynchronously, there shouldn\'t be an issue. However, the user pointed out that the `runShortcut` function needs to be initiated from a specific session, suggesting that it might be incorrectly checking for a session even when it\'s obvious we are already in the right context.**Analyzing openModal reference issues**\n\nI\'m diving into why `openModal` isn\'t functioning properly, especially with the potential of it being overshadowed by global definitions across extensions. If another extension resets `window.openModal`, it could affect the setting of `currentSessionId`. Interestingly, when I look at the code, it seems there\'s confusion with scoping and how it\'s declared. In module scope, if `openModal` isn\'t explicitly declared, it should throw a ReferenceError, yet the user reports a different error about needing to select a session. This suggests there\'s something obscure happening in the execution context or with how the environment resolves variable references.**Diagnosing the openModal and closeModal issues**\n\nI\'m digging into why `openModal` might not be working as intended. Given that `openModal` is referenced incorrectly as a variable instead of calling `window.openModal`, this means `currentSessionId` remains null, leading to the alert asking users to select a session. If an error occurs, it disrupts the code execution flow. Even though the modal might appear visible, it seems the shortcuts aren\'t actionable due to these underlying issues. I suspect the root cause lies in the unqualified calls to `openModal` and `closeModal`, which should be prefixed with `window.` to avoid any ReferenceErrors.**Compiling the Diagnosis**\n\nI want to start by reporting my diagnosis clearly and concisely, pointing to specific code lines, and suggesting a minimal fix while offering to apply it if the user wants. I should follow the guidelines by organizing this into bullet points with code identifiers in monospace. \n\nFirst, checking backend route names shows consistency between front and backend. The issue arises because `openModal` is referenced incorrectly, causing `currentSessionId` to remain null in an ES module context. When fetching shortcuts, the user only sees "select a session," masking the underlying ReferenceError. I’ll outline the root cause, impact, proof, fix options, and next steps.'}]

[{'type': 'output_text', 'text': "I’ve read CORE_API_MANUAL.md, docs/UI_FLOW.md, docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md, and SESSIONS_AGENT.txt, then traced the extension code.\n\n**Root Cause**\n- In `app/extensions/sessions_and_shortcuts/main.js`, the code defines `window.openModal` and `window.closeModal`, but later calls `openModal(...)`/`closeModal(...)` without the `window.` prefix.\n- Because the extension is loaded as an ES module (dynamic `import` in `app/templates/index.html`), unqualified globals don’t resolve to `window.*` in strict mode. That call throws before `currentSessionId` is set.\n\n**Why You See “Select a session first”**\n- The click handler for “Run Shortcut...” does:\n  - `api.get('shortcuts').then(renderShortcuts);`\n  - `openModal('shortcut-modal', sid);` ← throws ReferenceError in module strict mode.\n- The fetch still completes and renders the shortcut list, but `currentSessionId` never gets set (the modal open step failed), so clicking a shortcut triggers the alert that a session must be selected.\n\n**Evidence (pointers)**\n- Define globals: `window.openModal = (modalId, sid) => { currentSessionId = sid; ... }` and `window.closeModal = ...` (main.js, ~lines 57–67).\n- Called incorrectly: `openModal('command-modal', sid)` and `openModal('shortcut-modal', sid)` (~lines 101, 103) and `closeModal(...)` uses (~lines 78, 122) without `window.`.\n\n**Fix Options**\n- Minimal: Replace unqualified calls with `window.openModal(...)` and `window.closeModal(...)`.\n- Better: Define local functions and keep globals only for template buttons:\n  - `const openModal = (modalId, sid) => { currentSessionId = sid; document.getElementById(modalId).style.display = 'block'; };`\n  - `const closeModal = (modalId) => { document.getElementById(modalId).style.display = 'none'; };`\n  - Keep `window.closeModal = closeModal` for the template `onclick`.\n\nWould you like me to apply the minimal patch in `main.js` to use `window.openModal`/`window.closeModal` (or refactor to local functions as above)?"}]

I’ll focus on creating useful documentation for the user\'s extension, following a structured format and including code snippets. Also, I\'ll suggest other extensions in a separate section.**Drafting proposals documentation**\n\nI should add a markdown document named PROPOSALS.md at the root.

Key proposals include UX improvements, reliability enhancements, security measures, API adjustments, and modal improvements with suggestions like deep-link invocation. I’ll also include code snippets to showcase improved JS patterns and outline guiding principles like idempotence and single source of truth. Finally, I can propose backend modifications while adhering to core restrictions.**Providing Sample Code**\n\nI need to create sample code that covers various aspects of our proposals. For telemetry, I\'ll include debug logs with flags. In the accessibility section, I’ll add ARIA attributes for modals and a focus trap. Performance improvements might involve virtual rendering if there are many sessions. \n\nFor framework proposals, I’ll outline common UI utilities, a typed API client, lifecycle hooks, and a standardized API for sessions.

It will include a title, an author entry for SESSIONS_AGENT, and the date. \n\nIn the "Sessions & Shortcuts Proposals" section, I\'ll list several proposals. For example, I want to unify modal helpers to enhance module safety, introduce a session-aware context propagation pattern, and suggest showing backend error messages in a toast/modal. \n\nI\'ll also propose enhancements for the shortcut list, run feedback notifications, optional stream output, and kill confirmation details. Each proposal will have supporting code snippets where necessary.**Addressing Accessibility and Proposals**\n\nI\'m thinking about accessibility and keyboard support, like implementing focus traps. \n\nIn the "Framework Proposals" section, I want to provide UI primitives like ModalManager and Toast, establish a standard API error envelope to ensure error messages are always returned in JSON, and introduce an event bus. I’ll also suggest typing for the Extension SDK and server-sent events for streaming logs.\n\nFor cross-extension ideas, I\'ll propose integration between Sessions and the Shortcut Wizard, along with a PATH Executable Picker.

Items are scoped to avoid breaking existing UI or logic; changes favor incremental adoption and clear separation between extension-local enhancements and framework-level utilities.\n+\n+## Sessions & Shortcuts (This Extension)\n+\n+### 1) Modal Utilities: Module-Safe, No Global Assumptions\n+- Usefulness: Prevents subtle failures when modules run in strict mode; easier testing and reuse.\n+- Principle: Keep local helpers in-module and expose only the minimal surface needed for inline HTML compatibility.\n+- Snippet (pattern we now follow):\n+```js\n+// main.js — local helpers\n+const openModal = (modalId, sid) => {\n+  if (sid != null) currentSessionId = sid;\n+  const el = document.getElementById(modalId);\n+  if (el) el.style.display = 'block';\n+};\n+const closeModal = (modalId) => {\n+  const el = document.getElementById(modalId);\n+  if (el) el.style.display = 'none';\n+};\n+// expose for template onclicks without relying on globals elsewhere\n+window.closeModal = closeModal;\n+window.openModal = openModal;\n+```\n+\n+### 2) Context Propagation: Session-Aware Actions Without Hidden State\n+- Usefulness: Reduces reliance on mutable globals like `currentSessionId`; actions become self-describing and resilient.\n+- Heuristic: Prefer passing `sid` through DOM dataset attributes and function parameters.\n+- Snippet:\n+```js\n+// When building a menu, keep sid attached to actionable elements\n+sessionEl.querySelectorAll('.menu-item').forEach(item => {\n+  item.dataset.sid = session.sid;\n+});\n+\n+// When handling an action, read from event target\n+const sid = target.closest('.menu-item')?.dataset.sid || currentSessionId;\n+openModal('shortcut-modal', sid);\n+```\n+\n+### 3) Error Surfacing: Preserve Backend Messages\n+- Usefulness: Users can diagnose why a run failed (permissions, missing file, etc.).\n+- Principle: Always parse JSON error bodies; show a concise message.\n+- Snippet (fetch wrapper pattern):\n+```js\n+async function apiCall(path, opts) {\n+  const res = await fetch(path, opts);\n+  if (!res.ok) {\n+    let detail = '';\n+    try { const j = await res.json(); detail = j.error || JSON.stringify(j); } catch {}\n+    throw new Error(detail || `${res.status} ${res.statusText}`);\n+  }\n+  return res.json();\n+}\n+\n+// usage in extension\n+api.post(`sessions/${sid}/shortcut`, { path })\n+  .then(() => notify('Shortcut queued'))\n+  .catch(err => toast(`Failed: ${err.message}`));\n+```\n+\n+### 4) Shortcut List UX: Search, Sort, and Group\n+- Usefulness: Scales when `~/.shortcuts` contains many items; faster selection.\n+- Heuristics:\n+  - Local, client-side search over name/path.\n+  - Sort by last-used frequency (persist a small LRU in `localStorage`).\n+  - Group by top-level folder.\n+- Snippet (LRU update):\n+```js\n+function bumpUsage(shortcutPath) {\n+  const key = 'te.shortcut.usage';\n+  const map = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || '{}');\n+  map[shortcutPath] = (map[shortcutPath] || 0) + 1;\n+  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(map));\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### 5) Run Feedback: Non-Blocking Confirmation\n+- Usefulness: Confirms action without modal churn; avoids duplicate submissions.\n+- Principle: Optimistic UI with a toast and temporary disabled state.\n+- Snippet:\n+```js\n+runBtn.disabled = true;\n+api.post(`sessions/${sid}/shortcut`, { path })\n+  .then(() => toast('Shortcut sent'))\n+  .finally(() => { runBtn.disabled = false; closeModal('shortcut-modal'); });\n+```\n+\n+### 6) Optional Output Peek: Tail Recent Output\n+- Usefulness: Quick feedback to confirm a command ran (when sessions log to a known file or support attach).\n+- Approach: Offer a non-default “Show recent output” toggle that tries to tail a pre-agreed log (if available) or uses a future streaming API (see framework proposals).\n+- Guardrails: Disabled by default to avoid perf hits and privacy concerns; explicit user action required.\n+\n+### 7) Confirmation Context: Rich Kill Dialog\n+- Usefulness: Prevents accidental termination by showing context (cwd, uptime).\n+- Heuristic: If metadata exposes these values, include them; otherwise fall back to current minimal confirm.\n+- Snippet (UI only, optional):\n+```js\n+if (confirm(`Kill session ${sid} (cwd: ${session.cwd})?`)) {\n+  api.delete(`sessions/${sid}`).then(refreshSessions);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### 8) Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation\n+- Usefulness: Better mobile screen-reader support and power-user flow.\n+- Principles: Focus trap within modals, `Esc` to close, ARIA labels.\n+- Snippet (focus trap skeleton):\n+```js\n+function trapFocus(modal) {\n+  const foci = modal.querySelectorAll('button, [href], input, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex=\"-1\"])');\n+  // add keydown handler to cycle focus\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Framework-Level Proposals\n+\n+### A) Shared UI Primitives: Modal and Toast Manager\n+- Usefulness: Reduces duplication; standardizes UX across extensions.\n+- Guideline: Provide a tiny, dependency-free module exposed by the core page that extensions can call.\n+- Snippet (interface sketch):\n+```js\n+// window.teUI\n+const teUI = {\n+  modal: { open(id, ctx), close(id) },\n+  toast: (msg, opts = {}) => { /* position, type, timeout */ },\n+};\n+```\n+\n+### B) Fetch Wrapper With Consistent Error Envelope\n+- Usefulness: Single place to parse JSON, map errors, add CSRF headers if needed.\n+- Backend Guideline: Always return `{ ok: boolean, error?: string, data?: any }`.\n+- Frontend Snippet:\n+```js\n+async function teFetch(url, options) {\n+  const res = await fetch(url, options);\n+  const body = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));\n+  if (!res.ok || body.error) throw new Error(body.error || `${res.status}`);\n+  return body.data ?? body; // backwards compatible\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### C) Extension Event Bus\n+- Usefulness: Enables cross-extension features without tight coupling (e.g., Sessions opens Shortcut Wizard to edit a script).\n+- API: `teBus.on(event, fn)`, `teBus.emit(event, payload)`.\n+- Snippet:\n+```js\n+const teBus = (() => { const m = new Map();\n+  return {\n+    on: (e, f) => (m.has(e) ? m.get(e).push(f) : m.set(e, [f])),\n+    emit: (e, p) => (m.get(e) || []).forEach(f => f(p)),\n+  };\n+})();\n+window.teBus = teBus;\n+```\n+\n+### D) Typed Extension SDK (JSDoc/TS Types)\n+- Usefulness: Autocomplete and safer refactors without adding a build step.\n+- Principle: Ship `.d.ts` or JSDoc typedefs for the API object given to extensions.\n+- Snippet:\n+```js\n+/** @typedef {{ get:(e:string)=>Promise<any>, post:(e:string,b:any)=>Promise<any>, delete:(e:string)=>Promise<any> }} ExtApi */\n+/** @param {HTMLElement} container @param {ExtApi} api */\n+export default function init(container, api) { /* ... */ }\n+```\n+\n+### E) Optional Streaming: SSE/WebSocket for Session Output\n+- Usefulness: Live feedback for long-running commands without polling.\n+- Backend Sketch (Flask + SSE):\n+```python\n+@app.route('/api/stream/<sid>')\n+def stream(sid):\n+    def gen():\n+        yield 'data: {\"ready\": true}\\n\\n'\n+        # tail -f or dtach attach read loop\n+    return Response(gen(), mimetype='text/event-stream')\n+```\n+- Frontend Sketch:\n+```js\n+const es = new EventSource(`/api/stream/${sid}`);\n+es.onmessage = (e) => appendOutput(JSON.parse(e.data));\n+```\n+\n+## Cross-Extension Ideas\n+\n+### 1) Sessions ↔ Shortcut Wizard Deep Link\n+- Usefulness: Quickly jump from selecting a shortcut to editing it if it fails.\n+- Flow: Sessions emits `shortcut:edit` with a path; Shortcut Wizard listens and opens the editor preloaded with that script.\n+- Snippet:\n+```js\n+// Sessions\n+teBus.emit('shortcut:edit', { path });\n+// Shortcut Wizard\n+teBus.on('shortcut:edit', ({ path }) => openEditorWith(path));\n+```\n+\n+### 2) PATH Executable Picker as Shared Utility\n+- Usefulness: Reuse across Wizard and other extensions.\n+- Guideline: Implement once in core or as a tiny helper extension that exposes a modal via `teBus`.\n+\n+### 3) Safety Guard for Executing Scripts\n+- Usefulness: Avoid accidental execution outside trusted directories.\n+- Heuristic: If a selected file is outside `~/.shortcuts`, show a warning and require confirmation; allow whitelist in settings.\n+- Snippet (client-side guard):\n+```js\n+function isSafeShortcut(p) {\n+  return p.startsWith(`${HOME}/.shortcuts/`);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Adoption Plan (Incremental)\n+\n+1. Introduce fetch wrapper and toast utility locally in Sessions & Shortcuts.\n+2. Add search + LRU sort in shortcut modal (no API changes).\n+3. Publish a minimal `teBus` in the core page; wire optional cross-extension actions.\n+4. Standardize error envelope in backend responses (non-breaking if we keep current fields).\n+5. Explore optional SSE endpoint for live output, guarded by a feature flag.\n+\n+All proposals are opt-in and aim to maintain current UI structure and user flows while improving robustness, UX, and extensibility.\n+\n*** End Patch"

[{'type': 'reasoning_text', 'text': '**Creating documentation proposal**\n\nI need to create a PROPOSALS.md file with entries, following developer instructions and the AGENTS.md guidelines. I can create files within the sandbox, but I need to be cautious since there\'s full access and no approval required. It’s good to go ahead, but I should only modify the core code if specifically requested. I’ll focus on creating useful documentation for the user\'s extension, following a structured format and including code snippets. Also, I\'ll suggest other extensions in a separate section.**Drafting proposals documentation**\n\nI should add a markdown document named PROPOSALS.md at the root. The sections will include an overview, entry information for our SESSIONS_AGENT, and proposals focused on Sessions & Shortcuts. Key proposals include UX improvements, reliability enhancements, security measures, API adjustments, and modal improvements with suggestions like deep-link invocation. I’ll also include code snippets to showcase improved JS patterns and outline guiding principles like idempotence and single source of truth. Finally, I can propose backend modifications while adhering to core restrictions.**Providing Sample Code**\n\nI need to create sample code that covers various aspects of our proposals. For telemetry, I\'ll include debug logs with flags. In the accessibility section, I’ll add ARIA attributes for modals and a focus trap. Performance improvements might involve virtual rendering if there are many sessions. \n\nFor framework proposals, I’ll outline common UI utilities, a typed API client, lifecycle hooks, and a standardized API for sessions. I should also suggest Shortcut Wizard improvements, inter-extension integration, and include code snippets for HTTP endpoints (Flask) and JS while adhering to formatting guidelines for clarity.**Drafting PROPOSALS.md Content**\n\nI\'m planning to add a PROPOSALS.md document at the root and draft its content in a structured way. It will include a title, an author entry for SESSIONS_AGENT, and the date. \n\nIn the "Sessions & Shortcuts Proposals" section, I\'ll list several proposals. For example, I want to unify modal helpers to enhance module safety, introduce a session-aware context propagation pattern, and suggest showing backend error messages in a toast/modal. \n\nI\'ll also propose enhancements for the shortcut list, run feedback notifications, optional stream output, and kill confirmation details. Each proposal will have supporting code snippets where necessary.**Addressing Accessibility and Proposals**\n\nI\'m thinking about accessibility and keyboard support, like implementing focus traps. \n\nIn the "Framework Proposals" section, I want to provide UI primitives like ModalManager and Toast, establish a standard API error envelope to ensure error messages are always returned in JSON, and introduce an event bus. I’ll also suggest typing for the Extension SDK and server-sent events for streaming logs.\n\nFor cross-extension ideas, I\'ll propose integration between Sessions and the Shortcut Wizard, along with a PATH Executable Picker. An implementation plan will be included with phased options and code snippets in both JS and Flask. I\'ll ensure we maintain the guideline of not modifying core files but can still create the relevant documentation.'}]
