Short version: yes—you can mirror this page’s behavior with a **headless background listener**. The page is just a thin WebSocket client; you can implement the same message protocol in your framework (no visible UI) and stream everything to your console app.

# What this page actually does
- Opens a **WebSocket** to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/`.  
- Sends JSON “blocks” to delimit a user turn:
  - `{ "role":"user", "start": true }`
  - `{ "role":"user", "type":"message", "content": "<your text>" }`
  - `{ "role":"user", "end": true }`
- Optional controls:
  - **Approve code:** sends a `"type":"command"` block with `"content":"go"` wrapped with `start/end`.
  - **Auth:** sends `{ "auth": "dummy-api-key" }`.
- Displays messages by parsing incoming JSON frames and appending either:
  - assistant text (`role:"assistant", type:"message"`),
  - console output (`role:"computer", type:"console", format:"output"`),
  - assistant code (`role:"assistant", type:"code"`),
  - or falls back to dumping the whole JSON.

# Easiest “background listener” design
Build a tiny **bridge service** inside your framework that keeps a single WS connection open to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/` and re-emits events to your UI (or logs):

1) **Singleton WS client** (backend):
- On start, connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- Optionally send an **auth** frame if you use one.
- Maintain a ring buffer or append-only log of received frames (`assistant`, `computer.console.output`, `assistant.code`, etc.).
- Expose:
  - `POST /oi/send` → accepts `{text:"…"}`; the bridge wraps it in the 3 JSON blocks (`start`, `message`, `end`) before `ws.send()`.
  - `POST /oi/approve` → sends the command “go” sequence (same start/command/end).
  - `GET /oi/stream` → server-sent events (SSE) that forwards each incoming WS frame to the frontend console app.
  - `GET /oi/log` → returns recent messages for your console pane.

2) **Console UI** (frontend, your new “OI Console” app):
- Keep your monospace console + prompt.
- On submit, `POST /oi/send`.
- Subscribe to `GET /oi/stream` (SSE) to append lines live.
- Add an **Approve Code** button wired to `POST /oi/approve`.

This gives you the “background listener” you want without relying on the original page—your framework owns the connection and history/logging, while the server still maintains its own transient history.

# Why not a service worker / hidden page?
- Service workers don’t support **WebSocket** directly; they’re fetch/SSE-oriented. You’d still need a page or a backend process to keep a socket open reliably. A backend bridge is simpler and survives UI navigation.

# Protocol you need to mirror (from the page)
- **User turn wrapper**:
  - `{ "role":"user","start":true}`
  - `{ "role":"user","type":"message","content":"<prompt>"}`  
  - `{ "role":"user","end":true}`
- **Approve code**:
  - `{ "role":"user","type":"command","start":true}`
  - `{ "role":"user","type":"command","content":"go"}`
  - `{ "role":"user","type":"command","end":true}`
- **Auth** (if required): `{ "auth":"<api-key>"}`

# How model cards still “hydrate” Open Interpreter
- Your **model card** decides how you launch `interpreter --server` (provider, api_base, api_key, context_window, temperature, etc.). Keep launching the server from a framework shell using those flags.
- The **bridge** is provider-agnostic; it only speaks the WS protocol shown above, so you don’t have to change it when cards change.

# Minimal wiring checklist
- [ ] Keep `interpreter --server` supervised (per your existing shell manager).
- [ ] Start bridge after server is up; reconnect on drop.
- [ ] Provide `/oi/send`, `/oi/approve`, `/oi/stream`, `/oi/log`.
- [ ] Point your standalone console UI at those endpoints (no coupling to the legacy chat).
- [ ] Optionally persist the bridge log if you want transcripts beyond the server’s own memory.
