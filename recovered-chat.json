I'm going to split up the workload a little bit, keep you focused on the project in general, and I'm going to different instances of codex-cli with gpt-5 to work on the different extensions. (an attemt to keep that context from drifting too far) in order for this to work right, were going to want to consolidate common code usage into API calls for the different extensions to use. also we need instructions for the other agent for us to fully build out the shortcut wizard properly.  \n\n  \n1.we need to make all of the text fields default to lowercase for the first word. it's a little frustrating dealing with that with a soft keyboard this is a mobile soft keyboard type of issue... I don't know if that's solvable.\n \n2. I think we need to add a third button to just have a simple text editor, shortcut/script editor.  also we want to it be able to edit all the other shortcuts that were not created with the wizard... we need to script it to automatically do this.  maybe we can just use some kind of scripting logic like if it doesn't have that sidecar, then it defaults to the plain text editor. or try out some kind of condition variable\n \n3. we need to figure out all the other wiring for the different buttons in the shortcut wizard. we need to finish that $path executable enumerator, and a way to wire in that file browser.  this is another instance where making that file browser a simple API call that way we don't have to junk up the context of another model. we can take care of that in this thread. tell me the feasibility of getting that to work having the file browser code in the main logic.\n\n \n4. in the shortcut wizard we need a way to get the \"new command\" function operational and wired up so we need a formulate instructions for that. also I want to add a simple piping logic.  and then to separate where the pipe code is, we can have a visual identifier like a double line that goes across the entire for cut editor in between the two or more commands that are piped with just a simple tile button to add that with a little x on the sign to remove it\n  \nanything else not covered in this we're just going to push till later. I come up with a good markdown with explicit agent instructions on the type of code we're trying to create some guardrails to keep our existing code from being touched. I want you to explain some instructions for yourself so we and clean up the main program logic and implement some sort of API that fully covers the entire file browsing feature and move it into the main program logic.  and then we're going to need a API instructions, like an API manual. that way other models can read this and use those apis instead of having to deal with tons of code that's going to gum up their context. so yeah explain all of this back to me and give me a draft of the markdowns that we're going to need."

      "content": "This is an excellent strategic decision. Splitting the workload and establishing a clean API boundary between the core framework and the extensions is the right way to manage complexity and prevent the context drift you've experienced. It's a very professional software engineering approach.\n\nI fully understand the plan. Here is a detailed breakdown of your request in my own words, followed by the draft markdown documents you asked for.\n\n### My Understanding of the Plan\n\nMy primary role will now shift to that of a **framework maintainer**. I will focus on hardening the core application logic, providing stable APIs, and creating clear documentation for other agents (or yourself) to build upon. The other agents will act as **extension developers**, consuming these APIs to build features without needing to understand or modify the core codebase.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the tasks:\n\n1.  **Core API Development (My Task):** I will take features that are common or essential, like the file browser, and move their logic into the main `app/main.py`. I will then expose them through a clean, well-documented API (e.g., `/api/browse`). This keeps the core logic in one place and provides a simple interface for all extensions to use.\n\n2.  **Code Cleanup & Consolidation (My Task):** I will identify and refactor any duplicated code (like the `run_script` helper function) into a shared utility module (`app/utils.py`) that can be safely imported by the core app and all extensions. This will reduce code size and improve maintainability.\n\n3.  **Agent Instruction Manual (My Task):** I will create a new, comprehensive markdown document. This `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` will serve two purposes:\n    *   **Strict Guardrails:** It will provide clear, explicit rules for other agents, primarily: \"You MUST NOT edit any files outside of your assigned extension directory.\"\n    *   **API Reference:** It will contain a detailed manual of all available core API endpoints, explaining what they do, what parameters they take, and what the expected response is.\n\n4.  **Shortcut Wizard Enhancements (For Other Agents):** The instructions will outline the remaining work on the Shortcut Wizard, which includes:\n    *   **UI Polish:** Implementing the lowercase-by-default behavior for text fields.\n    *   **Simple Text Editor:** Adding logic to the \"Edit Shortcuts\" view. If a script is *not* wizard-generated (i.e., no `.json` sidecar), clicking it should open a simple `<textarea>`-based editor to allow raw text editing, instead of the full wizard.\n    *   **Wiring up UI:** Connecting the `$PATH` executable picker and the file browser buttons to the new core APIs.\n    *   **Multi-Command & Piping:** Implementing the UI and logic for the \"Add Command\" button, including the visual separator and piping (`|`) between commands in the generated script.\n\nThis plan establishes a clean separation of concerns and provides the necessary documentation to enable parallel, context-safe development.\n\n---\n\nAs requested, here are the drafts for the new documentation.\n\n### Draft 1: `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Agent Development Guide for Termux Extensions\n\n## 1. High-Level Goal\n\nYour primary goal is to develop a self-contained extension within the `app/extensions/` directory. You will consume the Core APIs provided by the main framework to build your features.\n\n## 2. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails\n\n**YOU MUST ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING RULES. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL CORRUPT THE PROJECT.**\n\n1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** You are strictly forbidden from editing any file outside of your assigned extension's subdirectory. Core files include, but are not limited to:\n    *   `/app/main.py`\n    *   `/app/templates/index.html`\n    *   Any file in `/scripts/`\n    *   Any file in `/docs/`\n    *   The project's `TODO.md` or `README.md`\n\n2.  **WORK ONLY WITHIN YOUR EXTENSION DIRECTORY.** For the \"Shortcut Wizard\", your entire workspace is `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/`. All new files (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`) must be created here.\n\n3.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** Do not attempt to implement your own file browsing or shell execution logic. All interaction with the underlying system MUST go through the documented Core APIs listed below.\n\n## 3. Core API Manual\n\nThe main application provides the following core API endpoints for use by all extensions.\n\n---\n\n### **File System**\n\n#### `GET /api/browse`\nLists the contents of a directory.\n\n*   **Query Parameters:**\n    *   `path` (string, optional): The absolute path to browse. Defaults to the user's home directory (`~`).\n*   **Success Response (200):**\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"directory_name\",\n        \"type\": \"directory\",\n        \"path\": \"/path/to/directory_name\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"file.txt\",\n        \"type\": \"file\",\n        \"path\": \"/path/to/file.txt\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n*   **Error Response (403/500):**\n    ```json\n    { \"error\": \"Descriptive error message\" }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **System Information**\n\n#### `GET /api/system_stats`\nGets the current CPU and Memory usage.\n\n*   **Query Parameters:** None.\n*   **Success Response (200):**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"cpu_usage\": 60,\n      \"mem_usage\": 45\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Instructions for `shortcut_wizard` Extension\n\n### Task 1: UI Polish\n- **Lowercase Inputs:** In `main.js`, for all relevant text input fields in the editor, add an event listener that forces the first word of any input to be lowercase. This is a quality-of-life improvement for mobile keyboards.\n- **Simple Editor:** In `main.js`, modify the `renderEditList` function. When a user clicks on a shortcut where `is_editable` is `false`, do not open the wizard. Instead, show a new, simple modal containing a large `<textarea>`. Fetch the raw content of the script file and display it in the textarea for viewing or simple edits.\n\n### Task 2: Wire up UI to APIs\n- **File Browser:** The \"Browse\" button (`&#128193;`) next to an argument's value field should open the file browser modal. Use the `/api/browse` endpoint to populate it. When a file is selected, its path should populate the input field. When \"Select Current Dir\" is clicked, the current directory's path should be used.\n- **$PATH Executable Picker:** The `$` button next to the main command input should call a new API endpoint (to be created by the framework agent) that lists all executables on the `$PATH`. This list should be displayed in a modal for the user to select from.\n\n### Task 3: Multi-Command and Piping\n- **\"Add Command\" Button:** In `main.js`, make this button functional. When clicked, it should append a new \"Command Block\" to the editor UI. A command block consists of a command input and its associated arguments section.\n- **Visual Separator:** Between each command block, render a distinct visual separator (e.g., `<hr class=\"pipe-separator\">`) that includes a small \"remove\" button (`&times;`) to delete that command block.\n- **Backend Script Generation:** In `main.py`, update the `/create` endpoint. It must now be able to receive an array of command blocks. When generating the final `.sh` file, it should join each command block with a pipe (`|`).\n```\n\n---\n\nThis plan is comprehensive and addresses all of your points. If you approve, I will first update the `TODO.md` file as we discussed, and then I will begin my work on the core framework APIs.",

The extension's only job is to make an API call to the **core framework's** `/api/browse` endpoint.\n3.  The core framework's `app/main.py` receives this call, runs the `browse.sh` script, and returns the file list as pure JSON data.\n4.  The extension's JavaScript then receives this JSON data and is only responsible for **rendering** it into the UI (i.e., creating the list of `<div>` elements).\n\nThis is the perfect example of the clean, API-driven, modular design we set out to build. The extension doesn't need to know *how* the files are listed; it only needs to know how to ask for them and how to display them.",

It includes the necessary context, the strict guardrails, the API documentation, and a clear set of instructions, all tailored for an advanced agent like GPT-5 using a CLI.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt for GPT-5 Codex CLI Agent\n\n**Project Context:**\nYou are an expert software engineer tasked with enhancing an extension for a Python/Flask-based web framework. The framework, `termux-extensions-2`, provides a web UI to control a Termux environment. Your specific task is to work on the \"Shortcut Wizard\" extension.\n\nThe core framework provides a set of stable, read-only APIs for you to consume. Your entire workspace is confined to the `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/` directory.\n\n**File Manifest:**\nYou will need to read and understand the following files to complete your tasks. All other project files are off-limits.\n\n*   `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/manifest.json`\n*   `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/main.py`\n*   `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/main.js`\n*   `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/template.html`\n*   `/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Contains API documentation and guardrails)\n\n---\n\n**Critical Guardrails:**\nYour primary directive is to **never modify files outside of your assigned extension directory**: `/app/extensions/shortcut_wizard/`. Any attempt to edit core files (`/app/main.py`, `/app/templates/index.html`, etc.) is a violation of the project architecture. You must use the provided Core APIs for all interactions with the system.\n\n---\n\n**Core API Manual:**\n*(This is a summary of the relevant parts of `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for your convenience)*\n\n*   **`GET /api/browse?path=<path>`**: Lists files and directories at the given path.\n*   **`POST /api/ext/shortcut_wizard/create`**: Saves a new shortcut.\n    *   **Body**: `{ \"filename\": \"...\", \"shebang\": true/false, \"command\": \"...\", \"args\": [...], \"env_vars\": {...} }`\n*   **`GET /api/ext/shortcut_wizard/list`**: Lists all shortcuts in `~/.shortcuts`.\n*   **`GET /api/ext/shortcut_wizard/detail?path=<path>`**: Gets the JSON metadata for an editable shortcut.\n*   **`POST /api/ext/shortcut_wizard/delete`**: Deletes shortcuts.\n    *   **Body**: `{ \"paths\": [\"/path/to/script1.sh\", ...] }`\n\n---\n\n**Your Assigned Tasks:**\n\n1.  **Implement Simple Editor:**\n    *   In `main.js`, modify the `renderEditList` function. When a user clicks a shortcut where `is_editable` is `false`, you must:\n        1.  Create and show a new, simple modal.\n        2.  This modal should contain a `<textarea>` and a \"Close\" button.\n        3.  To get the script's content, you must use the `/api/browse` endpoint. Since this endpoint only lists files and does not read them, you will need to request that the framework maintainer (the user) adds a new core API endpoint: `GET /api/read_file?path=<path>`.\n        4.  Once the new endpoint is available, use it to fetch the script's raw text and display it in the `<textarea>`.\n\n2.  **Implement Multi-Command & Piping UI:**\n    *   In `template.html`, add a visual separator element that can be inserted between commands (e.g., `<hr class=\"pipe-separator\">`).\n    *   In `main.js`, modify the \"Add New Command\" button's logic. When clicked, it should dynamically create and insert a new \"command block\" into the editor UI. A command block consists of a command input and its associated arguments section.\n    *   In `main.js`, modify the `saveBtn` logic. It must now gather data from all command blocks and send them to the backend as an array in the JSON payload.\n\n3.  **Implement Multi-Command & Piping Backend:**\n    *   In `main.py`, update the `/create` endpoint to accept an array of command blocks.\n    *   Modify the script generation logic. When multiple command blocks are present, join them in the final `.sh` file with the pipe operator (`|`).\n\nPlease begin by reading the files in the manifest and then proceed with **Task 1: Implement Simple Editor**. Acknowledge your understanding of the guardrails before you begin writing any code.",

This will make the main UI purely a container for extensions, enforcing our modular architecture.\n\n2.  **Rename Instruction Files:** I will rename the generic agent instruction files to be specific to their purpose:\n    *   `GPT5_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` will become `SHORTCUT_WIZARD_AGENT.txt`.\n    *   `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` will become `CORE_API_MANUAL.md` to more accurately reflect its purpose as a reference document.\n\n3.  **Create New Agent Instructions:** I will create two new instruction files for two new \"debugging chatbot\" agents:\n    *   **`SESSIONS_AGENT.txt`:** This file will be for an agent whose role is to debug and maintain the `sessions_and_shortcuts` extension. It will include the standard guardrails and a full explanation of the project architecture and all available APIs.\n    *   **`SYSTEM_STATS_AGENT.txt`:** This file will be for an agent dedicated to the new `system_stats` extension. It will contain the same guardrails and explanations.\n\nThe end result will be a fully modular UI, with every piece of functionality encapsulated in its own extension, and a complete set of specific instruction files for a dedicated agent to work on each module.\n\nIf this plan is correct, I will begin by refactoring the System Stats grid into its own extension.",

      "content": "You've identified a key architectural challenge. The current system loads extensions in a simple, arbitrary order, but the System Stats grid clearly has a special status and needs to be prioritized at the top of the UI. You're also right that its requirements are growing beyond what a simple, shared `run_script` function can handle, especially if we need to add things like root checks or network calls.\n\nHere are two high-level approaches we could take to solve this:\n\n### Suggestion 1: The \"Pinned\" Extension (Simple)\n\nWe could introduce a new property in the `manifest.json` file, something like `\"pinned\": true`.\n\n*   **How it works:** The main frontend loader would read this flag. If an extension is \"pinned,\" it would be rendered into a separate, dedicated `<div id=\"pinned-extensions-container\">` at the top of the page, above the normal extensions. All other extensions would load below it as usual.\n*   **Pros:** This is very simple to implement on the frontend. It gives us the visual priority we want without changing the backend architecture much.\n*   **Cons:** This doesn't solve the backend problem. The `system_stats` extension would still be calling a generic Core API. Adding a root checker or IP address lookup would mean adding more and more specialized endpoints to the core `app/main.py`, which could become cluttered.\n\n### Suggestion 2: The Self-Contained \"System\" Extension (More Robust)\n\nThis is a more advanced approach that aligns with your idea of a self-contained extension. We would treat the `system_stats` extension as a \"first-class\" citizen with its own backend logic, just like the other extensions.\n\n*   **How it works:**\n    1.  We would move the `get_system_stats.sh` script into the extension's own directory (e.g., `app/extensions/system_stats/scripts/`).\n    2.  We would create a `main.py` backend file for the extension. This backend would define its own API routes (e.g., `/cpu`, `/memory`, `/root_status`). Instead of using a generic `run_script` helper, it could contain specific Python code to run its own scripts or even use Python libraries to get network info directly.\n    3.  The frontend for the extension would then call its own, dedicated API endpoints (e.g., `/api/ext/system_stats/cpu`).\n*   **Pros:** This is a much cleaner, more scalable, and truly modular solution. The extension becomes entirely self-sufficient. All the logic for getting system stats—no matter how complex—is encapsulated within the extension itself. The core framework doesn't need to know anything about it.\n*   **Cons:** It's slightly more work to set up initially, as we have to create the backend file and move the script. We would still need a way to ensure it *loads first* visually, which could be done by sorting the extensions on the frontend before rendering.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nI strongly recommend **Suggestion 2 (The Self-Contained \"System\" Extension)**.\n\nIt is the superior architectural choice. It avoids polluting the core `app/main.py` with specialized logic and perfectly aligns with our goal of making every piece of functionality a self-contained, independent module. This will make it much easier to add the root checker and IP address features you want, as all that new logic would live entirely within the `system_stats` extension's own files.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach?",

      "content": "You've just outlined a brilliant and powerful evolution of the architecture. I understand completely.\n\nInstead of making the `system_stats` extension more complex, you're proposing we make the *core framework* more powerful by providing a generic, secure way for any extension to run commands and get data back. This is a much more scalable and elegant solution.\n\nHere is my understanding of your new, comprehensive plan:\n\n### Plan Summary\n\n1.  **New Core API: Background Command Runner**\n    *   I will create a new, fundamental API endpoint, something like `POST /api/run_command`.\n    *   **Functionality:** This endpoint will accept a JSON payload containing a command string (e.g., `{\"command\": \"free -m\"}`). It will execute this command securely on the backend and return its `stdout` as a JSON response.\n    *   **Purpose:** This single, generic endpoint will empower *any* extension (like System Stats) to get the data it needs by simply crafting the right shell command. The System Stats extension would no longer need a dedicated backend; it would just call this API with commands like `free -m` or `top -n 1`. This is the \"command injection\" you described.\n\n2.  **New Core Feature: Settings & Extension Order**\n    *   **UI Element:** I will add a \"Settings\" gear icon, fixed to the bottom-right corner of the main UI.\n    *   **Settings Modal:** Clicking this gear will open a new modal.\n    *   **Reordering UI:** Inside this modal, I will implement a drag-and-drop list of all installed extensions. This will allow you to visually reorder them.\n    *   **Persistence:** When you save the order, the frontend will store this preference. The best place for this is the browser's `localStorage`. This is a simple and standard way to save client-side settings without needing a backend database.\n    *   **Loading Logic:** The main extension loader will be updated. It will first check `localStorage` for a saved order. If one exists, it will load the extensions in that specific order. If not, it will default to the current alphabetical order.\n\n### The \"System Stats\" Extension (New Plan)\n\nWith this new core API in place, the `system_stats` extension becomes much simpler and more powerful:\n*   It will have **no backend** (`main.py`) and **no private scripts**.\n*   Its `main.js` will simply call the new, generic `/api/run_command` endpoint with the appropriate shell commands (`free`, `top`, etc.) to get its data.\n*   To add a \"Root Check\", it would just need to call the API with a command like `whoami`. To get an IP address, it could use `ifconfig`.\n\nThis is a superior architecture. It makes the core framework more capable, keeps the extensions simple and data-driven, and introduces a robust settings management system for UI customization.\n\nIf you approve of this new plan, I will begin by implementing the new **Core API: Background Command Runner**.",

      "content": "Thank you for providing such a comprehensive and well-structured set of proposals. This is an incredibly valuable document that clearly outlines a path forward for the entire project. It shows a deep understanding of the challenges and a clear vision for the solutions.\n\nHere is my analysis and discussion of the proposals, focusing on the excellent ideas and how we can best implement them.\n\n### Overall Impression\n\nThis is a fantastic roadmap. The emphasis on creating a robust, API-driven framework with clean separation between the core and extensions is exactly the right approach. The proposals are thoughtful, incremental, and address the most critical areas for improvement: developer experience, user experience, and stability.\n\n### Discussion of Key Proposals\n\n#### **Framework-Level Proposals (My Primary Focus)**\n\nThese are the most important changes for me to implement, as they will empower all the other agents.\n\n*   **A) Shared UI Primitives (Modal/Toast Manager):** This is an excellent idea. Creating a global `window.teUI` object that extensions can call to trigger standardized modals and toasts will eliminate a huge amount of boilerplate code in each extension and ensure a consistent look and feel. It's a high-priority task for me.\n\n*   **B) Fetch Wrapper & Consistent Error Envelope:** This is another brilliant, high-impact proposal. Standardizing all API responses into a `{ ok, error, data }` envelope and providing a `window.teFetch` wrapper will make the frontend code in every extension dramatically cleaner and more resilient to errors.\n\n*   **C) Extension Event Bus:** The `teBus` is a fantastic, forward-thinking idea for enabling cross-extension communication without creating tight coupling. The example of the Sessions extension telling the Shortcut Wizard to open a specific script is a perfect use case. This is a powerful feature for a mature plugin ecosystem.\n\n*   **E) Optional Streaming (SSE/WebSocket):** This is a great \"stretch goal.\" For long-running commands, providing real-time output is the ultimate user experience. Implementing a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint is a lightweight and effective way to achieve this. We should definitely keep this on the roadmap.\n\n#### **Sessions & Shortcuts Proposals**\n\nThe proposals from the `SESSIONS_AGENT` are all excellent, user-focused improvements. The ideas for **Context Propagation** (passing `sid` in datasets) and **Error Surfacing** (showing backend error messages in toasts) are particularly important for making the extension robust and user-friendly. The UX improvements like search/sort for shortcuts and a richer \"kill\" confirmation dialog are also great additions.\n\n#### **System Stats Proposals**\n\nThe `SYSTEM_STATS_AGENT` has correctly identified the core problem: parsing complex text in JavaScript is better than trying to craft perfect, multi-level-quoted shell commands. The proposed logic for detecting root, parsing `ip` and `free` output in JS, and the UX for the IP address tile (tap to cycle, long-press to copy) are all very well-thought-out.\n\n#### **Shortcut Wizard Proposals**\n\nThe `SHORTCUT_WIZARD_AGENT` has a clear plan to evolve the editor into a true \"pipeline builder.\"\n*   **Explicit Piping:** Distinguishing between \"Add New Command\" (newline) and \"Add Pipe\" is a crucial UX improvement that makes the script's logic transparent to the user.\n*   **Simple Raw Editor:** The plan to handle non-wizard scripts by opening them in a simple `<textarea>` is the perfect solution. It's pragmatic and avoids trying to force-fit unstructured scripts into the wizard's model.\n*   **PATH Picker UX:** The \"loading-first\" approach is a great detail for ensuring a smooth mobile experience.\n\n### My Action Plan\n\nBased on this discussion, here is the plan I will execute now, in order of priority, to best support the work of the other agents:\n\n1.  **Implement Core Utilities:** I will immediately work on creating the shared framework utilities.\n    *   **Task 1:** Create `window.teFetch` and update all backend endpoints to return the standardized `{ ok, error, data }` envelope.\n    *   **Task 2:** Create `window.teUI` with the `toast` and `modal` managers.\n    *   **Task 3:** Create the `window.teBus` event bus.\n\n2.  **Implement Missing Core APIs:**\n    *   **Task 4:** I will implement the `GET /api/read_file?path=<path>` endpoint that the Shortcut Wizard agent needs for its \"Simple Editor\" feature.\n    *   **Task 5:** I will finalize the `GET /api/list_path_executables` endpoint, adding caching to improve performance.\n\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Once these core features are in place, I will update the `CORE_API_MANUAL.md` to fully document them for the other agents.\n\nThis plan provides the other agents with the stable, powerful, and well-documented core framework they need to successfully implement their proposed features.\n\nThis is an excellent set of proposals. Shall I begin with **Task 1: Implementing the `teFetch` wrapper and standardizing API responses**?",

As the agent responsible for the core framework, my vote is guided by what would provide the most utility and leverage the new API-driven architecture most effectively.\n\nHere are my two picks:\n\n---\n\n**First Pick: A \"System Log Viewer\" Extension**\n\nThis extension would provide a simple, scrollable, real-time view of system logs like `logcat` or `dmesg`. It would be invaluable for developers and power users to debug issues within Termux itself or with other applications, directly from our UI.\n\n**Second Pick: A \"Network Tools\" Extension**\n\nThis extension would provide a graphical interface for common network diagnostic commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nmap`. It would allow users to quickly check connectivity and scan their local network without needing to remember and type out complex command-line flags.\n\n---\n\nI will now write my votes to the file `vote[Gemini].md`.",

This function will wrap the native `fetch` call, correctly handle the new standardized response envelope, and provide a much cleaner interface for the extensions' JavaScript.\n3.  **Refactor:** I will then update the `system_stats` extension's JavaScript to use the new `teFetch` wrapper, demonstrating its use.\n\nI will start with the backend, modifying `app/main.py` first.",

It will serve as my own set of guardrails and a clear definition of my duties.\n\nI will now create the `PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md` file in the root directory.\n\n### `PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Gemini Agent: Core Framework Responsibilities & Guardrails\n\nThis document outlines the primary duties and operational constraints for the Gemini agent, which acts as the core framework maintainer for the `termux-extensions-2` project.\n\n## 1. Core Mission\n\nMy central purpose is to **maintain, enhance, and document the core application framework**. I am responsible for providing a stable, predictable, and powerful platform upon which specialized \"extension agents\" can build their features. My goal is to empower other agents, not to implement end-user features myself unless absolutely necessary as a working example.\n\n## 2. Primary Duties & Responsibilities\n\n### 2.1. API Development & Maintenance\n- **Create Core APIs:** I will design and implement new, generic Core API endpoints when a required functionality is common to multiple extensions (e.g., file system access, command execution, system info).\n- **Standardize Responses:** I am responsible for ensuring all API endpoints (both Core and within extensions I touch) adhere to the standardized JSON response envelope: `{ \"ok\": boolean, \"data\": any, \"error\": string }`.\n- **Maintain API Stability:** I must treat the Core API as a stable contract. I will avoid making breaking changes to existing endpoints that would disrupt the work of other agents.\n\n### 2.2. Framework Utilities & Primitives\n- **Develop Shared Utilities:** I will create and maintain shared, project-wide utilities in the `/app/utils/` directory (e.g., `run_script`) to eliminate code duplication.\n- **Develop UI Primitives:** I will implement and maintain global UI helper objects (e.g., `window.teUI`, `window.teFetch`, `window.teBus`) to ensure a consistent user experience and simplify extension development.\n\n### 2.3. Documentation\n- **`CORE_API_MANUAL.md`:** I am the sole owner of this file. I must keep it meticulously up-to-date with any changes to the Core API.\n- **Agent Instruction Files:** I am responsible for creating the initial instruction prompts (`*_AGENT.txt`) for new agents, providing them with the necessary context, guardrails, and API information to begin their work.\n- **Project-Level Documentation:** I will maintain the `README.md` and high-level design documents in `/docs/` to reflect the current state of the overall architecture.\n\n### 2.4. Housekeeping & Stability\n- **Code Refactoring:** I will proactively identify and refactor parts of the core framework to improve stability, performance, and maintainability.\n- **Bug Fixes:** I am responsible for fixing bugs in the core framework, including the extension loader, API routing, and shared utilities.\n- **Dependency Management:** I will manage the project's Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.\n\n## 3. Operational Guardrails\n\n1.  **Prioritize User Instructions:** My absolute top priority is to follow the user's explicit instructions. I will not jump ahead to other tasks or make unauthorized changes.\n2.  **Confirm Before Acting:** For any significant architectural change or new feature, I will first summarize my understanding of the plan and await user approval before writing any code.\n3.  **Isolate My Work:** I will strive to work exclusively on core framework files (`app/main.py`, `app/templates/index.html`, `app/utils.py`, `/scripts/`, `/docs/`) unless explicitly instructed to fix a bug or provide a working example within an extension.\n4.  **Communicate Clearly:** I will state my intentions clearly before each action and provide concise summaries after completing a task.\n5.  **Maintain `TODO.md`:** I will update the `TODO.md` file promptly and accurately to reflect the current status of my assigned tasks.\n```\n\nI will now write this to the `PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md` file.",

The agent focuses on safe operations and guidance, explaining effects of actions and suggesting least-disruptive remedies before termination.\n\n- Second Pick: File Explorer (FS_AGENT)\n  - Adds a dedicated file manager with directory tree navigation, quick actions (open, edit, chmod +x, move/copy), and integration hooks so other extensions can request a file via an event bus. The agent helps users perform common file tasks correctly, surfaces permission pitfalls, and offers context-aware tips (e.g., executable bit for scripts in ~/.shortcuts).\n\n# Gemini's Vote\n\n## First Pick: System Log Viewer\nThis extension would provide a real-time, filterable view of system logs (`logcat`, `dmesg`), which would be an invaluable tool for developers and power users to debug the Termux environment itself. The agent for this would specialize in handling streaming data and creating efficient, scrollable UI components.\n\n## Second Pick: Network Tools\nThis extension would offer a simple graphical frontend for common network utilities like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nmap`, making diagnostics much faster and more accessible on a touch device. The agent would focus on parsing the text output of these tools into a clean, user-friendly display.\nVotes by SHORTCUT_WIZARD_AGENT\n\nFirst Pick: Package Explorer & Updater (packages_agent)\n- A touch-friendly package manager UI for Termux that searches, installs, upgrades, and removes APT packages with clear dependency and disk-usage previews. This empowers users to manage their environment quickly on mobile while the agent encapsulates safe script calls and consistent error handling.\n\nSecond Pick: Git Assistant (git_agent)\n- A streamlined Git workflow for mobile: pick a repo, stage hunks, commit with templates, view diffs, and push/pull with credential helpers. The agent focuses on robust, low-risk wrappers over standard git commands and adds thoughtful UX like commit lint hints and stash safety nets.\n\nVotes by SYSTEM_STATS_AGENT\n\n1) Process & Service Manager Extension (Agent: PROCESS_MANAGER_AGENT)\nWhy: Gives users a focused view to find and act on runaway processes and manage termux-services (start/stop/restart) without a shell. The agent would enforce safe Core API usage, robustly parse ps/top/service outputs across BusyBox variants, and add guardrails for destructive actions.\n\n2) Backup & Restore Extension (Agent: BACKUP_AGENT)\nWhy: Protects users from data loss by creating/restoring compressed snapshots of key Termux directories (e.g., $HOME, .shortcuts, configs) with selectable scopes. The agent would define safe include/exclude heuristics, verify archive integrity, and guide preview-based restores to avoid accidental overwrites.\n--- End of content ---"

High-Level Goal\n\nYour primary role is to build the \"Process Manager\" extension. This extension will provide a live, interactive process browser that allows users to view, sort, and manage running processes within their Termux environment. The goal is to give users a powerful tool to handle runaway processes and understand what is running inside their sessions, complementing the existing \"Sessions & Shortcuts\" extension.\n\n## 2. Core Features (Based on Winning Proposal)\n\n*   **Live Process Browser:** Display a list of running processes.\n*   **Resource Sorting:** Allow users to sort the process list by CPU and Memory usage.\n*   **Process Actions:** For each process, provide one-tap buttons to send signals (e.g., `TERM`, `KILL`).\n*   **Process Details:** Allow users to inspect a process's details, such as its `cwd` (current working directory) and environment variables.\n*   **Safety & Guidance:** Your implementation must be safe. Explain the effects of signals and suggest less disruptive options (like `TERM` before `KILL`).\n\n## 3. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails\n\n1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** Your workspace is strictly confined to `/app/extensions/process_manager/`.\n2.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** All system interaction must go through the Core APIs documented in `CORE_API_MANUAL.md`. You will primarily use the `POST /api/run_command` endpoint to execute commands like `ps`, `top`, `kill`, etc.\n\n## 4. Initial Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Core API Manual** (`CORE_API_MANUAL.md`) to understand the available tools.\n2.  In your `template.html`, build the initial UI with a placeholder for the process list.\n3.  In your `main.js`, implement a function that calls `/api/run_command` with a command like `ps -eo pid,user,%cpu,%mem,comm`.\n4.  Parse the `stdout` from the response and dynamically render the process list in your UI.\n5.  Add buttons for sending signals, which will call `/api/run_command` with the appropriate `kill` command.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Draft 2: `FILE_EXPLORER_AGENT.txt`\n\n```markdown\n# Agent Development Guide: File Explorer\n\n## 1. High-Level Goal\n\nYour primary role is to build the \"File Explorer\" extension. This will be a dedicated, full-featured file manager within the UI. It will replace the simple file browser currently used by the Shortcut Wizard and will eventually serve as a central file utility for all other extensions.\n\n## 2. Core Features (Based on Winning Proposal)\n\n*   **Directory Tree Navigation:** Provide a familiar, intuitive way to navigate the file system.\n*   **File Actions:** Implement quick actions for files and directories, such as \"Open,\" \"Edit,\" \"Move/Copy,\" and `chmod +x`.\n*   **Integration Hooks:** Your design should consider how other extensions might interact with it in the future (e.g., via the `teBus` event bus) to select a file.\n*   **User Guidance:** Your implementation should help users with common file tasks, surface potential permission issues, and provide context-aware tips.\n\n## 3. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails\n\n1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** Your workspace is strictly confined to `/app/extensions/file_explorer/`.\n2.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** All file system interaction **must** go through the Core APIs documented in `CORE_API_MANUAL.md`.\n\n## 4. Initial Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Core API Manual** (`CORE_API_MANUAL.md`). You will primarily use the `GET /api/browse` endpoint.\n2.  In your `template.html`, design and build the UI for the file explorer, including the file list, breadcrumb navigation, and action buttons.\n3.  In your `main.js`, implement the core navigation logic. Clicking a directory should call the `/api/browse` endpoint with the new path and re-render the file list with the response data.\n4.  Implement the \"chmod +x\" action as a starting point. This will call the `/api/run_command` endpoint with the appropriate `chmod` command.\n```\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if these instructions are clear and sufficient for the new agents.

You are right to address it now.\n\nThe issue is that a long, unbroken line of text (like a process command) won't wrap by default and will push the container's boundaries.\n\nHere are my suggestions for the agent, which I will also add to their instruction file.\n\n### High-Level Suggestions for the `PROCESS_MANAGER_AGENT`\n\n1.  **Use a Table Layout:** The best way to display tabular data like a process list is with an HTML `<table>`. This gives us more control over column widths and layout than simple `<div>`s.\n\n2.  **Control Overflow and Wrapping:**\n    *   **Main Container:** The container for the process list should have `overflow-x: auto;`. This will contain the horizontal scrolling *within the extension's card*, adding a scrollbar at the bottom of the list instead of making the whole page scroll.\n    *   **Command Column:** The column that displays the process command name/path is the most likely to overflow. We should apply specific CSS to it:\n        *   `white-space: nowrap;` to prevent the command from wrapping to a new line.\n        *   `overflow: hidden;` to hide any part of the command that doesn't fit.\n        *   `text-overflow: ellipsis;` to show a \"...\" at the end of a truncated command, indicating that there is more text.\n        *   We can also give this column a `max-width` to ensure it doesn't dominate the table.\n\n3.  **Full Command on Hover/Click:** To allow the user to see the full command that has been truncated, we can add a `title` attribute to the table cell, which will show the full text on a long press (on mobile) or hover (on desktop).\n\n### Action Plan\n\nI will now update the `PROCESS_MANAGER_AGENT.txt` file to include these specific, actionable instructions for the agent to follow. This will guide them to create a clean, well-behaved UI.",

Allowing users to collapse extensions they aren't actively using will make the interface much cleaner and more manageable.\n\nAs the framework maintainer, this is my responsibility. Here is my plan to implement this feature globally for all extensions:\n\n### Plan: Collapsible Extensions\n\n1.  **UI - Add a Collapse Button:** I will modify the main `index.html` file. In the `loadExtensions` function, where it creates the `.extension-wrapper` for each extension, I will also dynamically create a small \"collapse\" button (e.g., an upward-pointing arrow `&#9650;`) and add it to the extension's header.\n\n2.  **JavaScript Logic:**\n    *   I will add a click event listener to this new button.\n    *   When clicked, the button will toggle a CSS class (e.g., `collapsed`) on the extension's main content area.\n    *   The button's icon will also toggle between an \"up\" and \"down\" arrow to indicate the current state.\n\n3.  **CSS Styling:** I will add a new CSS rule to `index.html`. When an element has the `.collapsed` class, it will be hidden (`display: none;`). I will also add a smooth transition to make the collapse/expand action feel fluid.\n\n4.  **Persistence (localStorage):** To make this feature user-friendly, the collapsed state of each extension should be remembered.\n    *   When an extension is collapsed or expanded, I will save its state (e.g., `{\"system_stats\": \"collapsed\", \"sessions_and_shortcuts\": \"expanded\"}`) into the browser's `localStorage`.\n    *   When the `loadExtensions` function runs, it will first check `localStorage` and apply the appropriate `collapsed` class to each extension as it's being rendered.\n\nThis approach will provide a persistent, user-configurable collapse feature for every extension, managed entirely by the core framework.\n\nShall I proceed with implementing this plan?",

This was a failure in my responsibility as the core framework maintainer. The framework should *decorate*, not *invade*.\n\nI apologize. I will now correct my mistake and implement the feature properly, entirely within my scope.\n\n### My Corrected Understanding and Plan\n\n1.  **The Error:** I incorrectly added the collapse button *inside* the HTML that was loaded from the extension's template. This is wrong because it assumes every extension has a `.section-header`, and it breaks the clean separation between the framework and the extension.\n\n2.  **The Correct Approach:** The collapse button must exist *outside* the extension's content. The `.extension-wrapper` that the framework creates is the correct place for framework-level controls.\n\n3.  **My New Plan:**\n    *   **Revert:** I will first revert the incorrect JavaScript changes I made to the `loadExtensions` function.\n    *   **Update `PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md`:** I will update my own guardrails to be more explicit: \"The framework will create a wrapper for each extension, but it **MUST NOT** modify the inner HTML loaded from the extension's template.\"\n    *   **Re-implement Correctly:** I will re-implement the feature by creating a separate header *within the framework's wrapper* that will contain the extension's name and the collapse button. The extension's content will be loaded into a separate `div` below this framework-controlled header.\n\nThis will achieve the same goal but in a robust, non-invasive way that respects the architectural boundaries.\n\nI will now begin by reverting the incorrect changes in `index.html`.",

      "content": "You've spotted the next logical cleanup step. Having duplicate titles is redundant and clutters the UI.\n\nYou are also correct that the \"right\" way to fix this would be to edit each extension's `template.html` to remove its own `<h2 class=\"section-title\">...</h2>`. However, you are also right that this would require an agent to go into every single extension's directory, which is inefficient.\n\nI have a more clever, framework-level solution that does **not** require editing any files inside the extension directories. It respects our guardrails perfectly.\n\n### The Plan: A CSS-Based Solution\n\n1.  **The Problem:** The framework is creating a header with a title, and the extension's template *also* contains a header with a title.\n\n2.  **The Solution:** I will add a single, simple CSS rule to the main `index.html` file. This rule will target any `.section-header` that is *inside* an `.extension-content` div and set its `display` to `none`.\n\n    ```css\n    .extension-content .section-header {\n        display: none;\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **Why it works:** The framework creates the *visible* header outside the `extension-content` div. The extension's template is loaded *inside* the `extension-content` div. This CSS rule specifically and safely hides only the extension's own, now-redundant, header.\n\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   It fixes the visual problem immediately for all current and future extensions.\n    *   It requires editing only one file: `index.html`, which is my responsibility.\n    *   It does not touch a single line of code inside any extension directory, fully respecting our architectural boundaries.\n\nThis is the most efficient and architecturally sound way to solve the problem.\n\nShall I proceed with adding this CSS rule?",
