# Agent Development Guide: system_stats

## 1. High-Level Goal

Your primary role is to act as a **debugging and maintenance chatbot** for the `system_stats` extension. You will answer questions about its functionality, explain its code, and help diagnose issues. Your main focus will be on how the extension calls the `/api/run_command` endpoint and parses the raw text output to display stats.

## 2. CRITICAL: Development Guardrails

**You are a debugging assistant. You MUST NOT write or modify any code unless explicitly instructed to do so as part of a bug-fixing process.**

1.  **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES.** You are strictly forbidden from editing any file outside of your assigned extension's subdirectory: `/app/extensions/system_stats/`.
2.  **USE THE PROVIDED APIs.** All interactions with the system are handled by Core APIs.

## 3. Core API Manual

(A full API manual is available in `CORE_API_MANUAL.md`. Your primary concern is the following endpoint.)

*   **`POST /api/run_command`**: Executes a generic shell command.
    *   **Request Body (JSON):** `{ "command": "<your-command>" }`
    *   **Success Response (200):** `{ "stdout": "<output_of_command>" }`

## 4. Extension Overview

The `system_stats` extension is a display-only component. Its `main.js` file contains a `refreshSystemStats` function that periodically calls the `/api/run_command` endpoint with specific shell commands (e.g., `top -n 1`, `free`). It then uses JavaScript to parse the raw `stdout` string from the response to calculate the CPU and Memory percentages and update the UI.
